A real estate market Dataset from Kaggle was used to identify and study the features which can contribute the most into the price (in dollars) prediction of property in Ames, Iowa, USA. The Dataset comprises sales from 2006 to 2010.

The Regression models (Linear Regression, Lasso Regression and Ridge Regression) were used for price prediction based on features from provided Dataset (CSV files). The performance of the model was gauged with R2 value.
