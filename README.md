# Projects at General Assembly
#### Data Science Immersive course

## Project 1 "SAT & ACT Analysis"
 - Standardized Testing
 - Statistical Summaries
 - Exploratory Data Analysis
 - Inference
The methods listed above, such as partnerships with school and university administrations and attracting students in states where payment is cancelled and both tests are accepted, must be combined with:

Active SMM on the Internet, promotion of articles on the benefits of SAT compared to ACT.
Promotion of videos with a detailed description of how to prepare for the test.
Using platforms such as Coursera and EdX.
Retain partnership with Khan Academy.
Establishing new scholarships for students who can creatively share their positive experience of - passing the test on social networks.
Cost reduction or cancellation for low-income students.

## Project 2 "Ames Housing Data"
 - Creating and iteratively refining a regression model
 - Using Kaggle to practice the modelling process
 - Providing business insights through reporting and presentation.

A real estate market Dataset from Kaggle was used to identify and study the features which can contribute the most into the price (in dollars) prediction of property in Ames, Iowa, USA. The Dataset comprises sales from 2006 to 2010.
The Regression models (Linear Regression, Lasso Regression and Ridge Regression) were used for price prediction based on features.

## Project 3 "Reddit APIs & Classification" 
 - Using Reddit's API, collect posts from two subreddits (Psychology and Astrology).
 - Use NLP to train a classifier on which subreddit a given post came from. This is a binary classification problem.

Modern Astrology uses a psychological approach and language which can be misleading for people.

The resulting model can be useful for:
layman people who cannot decide if the information comes from psychological science or astrological pseudoscience.
Moderators of r/psychology/ and r/astrology/ subreddits to save time from manual sorting of these two classes.

LogisticRegression is the best model with TfidfVectorizer for the problem. Test accuracy of 94.5 %
