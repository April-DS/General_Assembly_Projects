964,"Venus Retrograde Through the Houses: What You Can Expect. Tomorrow Venus stations retrograde in Gemini. Actually, Venus has been slowing down for a bit now, called a station, meaning her footprint is heavy in the sky. Likely, you've already been acquainted with the pitter pattering of themes you can expect during this period. Venus retrograde corresponds to general themes such as: relationship reviews, rewinds, renewals and reversals--evaluating how you relate to your own self-worth and esteem--retooling what you actually value/need--budgeting, getting serious about finances--hiccups with beauty related tools, industries, purchases and decisions.

**But Venus RX means more when you account for the house it will be drudging stuff up in**. My general take on Venus RX is: detouring into the ugly and resurfacing with a new appreciation of beauty.  Kind of like the plot of Shrek. Where are the ogres in your life? And can you just decide to marry them and live happily ever after in a swamp with your donkey dragon friends? I digress...

This RX will be decidedly less brutal than the 2018 one in Scorpio. Those were some dire, uggo times. Venus in Gemini is peregrine, and to me, far more effervescent. Like a La Croix. Some gross flavors. But mostly ok. The reviews and themes will have more to do with ideas, thoughts, beliefs, etc. Very much juggling many dissonant thoughts and being okay with not settling on a conclusion. This will be a mentally exhausting time for some.

Gemini occupies a house in everyone's chart. Welcome to the circus:

**First House**: a time to reconsider what makes you feel beautiful, to redefine what beauty has to mean and look like. a time of enhanced social awareness (from a distance) and learning how you bring a distinct value to people--but first settling on how you wish to value yourself. being comfortable with your many faces, but also eliminating the faces, the out-grown personalities, that do not suit you anymore

**Second House:** a time to reevaluate how material possessions add beauty, add value, add ease-- or completely distract you from the assets that matter the most. a renewed version of self-care, a hard and honest look at your bank account and closet and cabinets, a purging to make room for new beautiful things to bloom. divine dividends 

**Third House**:  a time to reconsider what needs to be said. holding space for new ideas to take the place of old ones. learning to value your unique perspective, whilst also respecting the perspectives of others. work that neuro plasticity, pave new grooves into your gray matter. a time to stop and smell the roses as you are out and about. rekindling bonds with siblings and teammates.

**Fourth House**: a time to spackle, paint, hang and rearrange. where has the beauty in your home become stagnant, and how can you insert new pathways of inspiration into your halls? retooling your roots, beautifying your sanctuaries, finding Aphrodite in your ancestry. this can be a time to reacquaint yourself with the value a tribe, a home, a family, and a foundation gives you. that's how beauty can blossom.

**Fifth House**: a time to make friends with that blinking cursor on a blank page, the dried paint brush, the stack of half-finished poetry in the corner of your room, and the project that makes your heart sing--but that you've been too afraid to sing along with. retool your relationship with your inner child, that spark in the dark. your authentic self could use some authenticating 

**Sixth House**: a time to throw out ugly habits, dead-end jobs, and the futile and self-deprecating sense of duty and responsibility you hold. time for new rituals. time put your worth and value ahead of the needs of others. you are more than a cog in a machine. you are the machine. an extraordinary one. and an extraordinary one needs all the tonics, tinctures, remedies and herbs. beautiful insides make for a beautiful outside, so celebrate your vitality, and appreciate all that your body does--in sickness and in health

**Seventh House**: a time to throw out ugly people! where are your relationships failing to live up to the happiness, joy, and wonder that you deserve? time for the talks, time to press send on an apology, time to ask for help, time to delete the dating profile and jump into the vulnerability of committed partnership, or time to unwed yourself from the security of singledom and start to mingle your heart out. also a good time to take inventory of the people you've invited into your hopes and dreams, the business affiliates that either help you sink or swim. choose people who bring beauty and warmth into your life. unbreak your heart. time for new patterns.

**Eighth House**: a time to get a handle on your debt, obligations, on your portfolios and investments. where are you over-sharing, where are you under-sharing, where can you give more, and where can you divest? immaterially, your heart, your humanness, your deeply disowned ugliness--they all deserve some TLC. those ogres aren't so scary or ugly when you get to know them. nothing to fear but fear itself. a time for magic and mysticism to inform your path forward.

**Ninth House**: a time to reevaluate your schooling, your education, what you have accepting as TRUTH actually has more to it.  become more nimble with your personal dogma and ideology. challenges to your way of seeing the world don't have to be challenging, but rather, give you a wider array of intellectual and cultural beauty to sample from and enjoy. though not a good time for travel, certainly still a good time to plan. that faraway corner of the world is calling out for you. and that faraway corner of your mind could use a refresh. where are your gurus and mentors failing to inspire you? ditch the old paradigms. there's a yellow brick road with your name on it.

**Tenth House:** a time to reevaluate your career, your place in the world, the value that you bring to the world, and your unique set of talents. where are you asking to be respected yet still bumping up against gatekeepers? where can your creativity be better suited? you are your own boss, and your manager can't manage you. time to step up into a firmer sense of self and confidence. take up space. be loud. this is your world and we are living in it.

**Eleventh House:** a time to reevaluate your social networks, your friend groups, your hopes, accomplishments and your communities at large. unfriend the group think. jettison the crusty cliques. deactivate the profiles. consider where society has perhaps let you down, and recommit to creating environments worthy of the cause that is you. there is beauty to be shared. humanity has cracks but that is where light enters. be the light, even if you need to go dark for now.

**Twelfth House:** a time to reconsider where you self-sabotage, where you isolate, where you needlessly alienate yourself and others. this can be a deeply creative time when you burrow in the right direction, where unconscious gifts lay, where spirituality sparkles, where the undulations of life at large are within your grasp. beautify your alone time, make it work for you. give your mental hardships some love and tenderness. play around with the unknown, remold your trauma and psychic entanglements, find the beauty in necessary endings and loss. for that is how you begin again.

965,"The Oversimplification of the Sextile (((The following is a write-up of a PERSONAL view of the Sextile aspect through PERSONAL research and experimentation. Feel free to agree or disagree. )))

Aspects have been an incredibly important staple in astrology since the study of the stars first began. The twelve signs of the zodiac are always “aspecting” each other - - viewing or existing conversationally in one way or another. Planets become energized by these aspects of signs, which can be more or less benefic (trine and sextile), malefic (opposition and square), or a  powerhouse of a wild card depending on the combination of planets involved (conjunction). 

Through the years of studying astrology, I’ve seen a great number of astrologers downplay the beauty of the sextile. The conjunction, the opposition, the trine, and the square are all payed adequate homage to, yet the sextile is either lumped in as a simpler satellite to the trine, downplayed as fundamentally weak, in league with minor aspects, or an aspect that shouldn’t be examined at all unless its orb of influence is particularly tight. 

I feel this is a great mistake. For one, the sextile IS a major aspect. According to the Thema Mundi, it carries the nature of beautiful planet Venus, because Venus-ruled Libra forms a sextile with Sun-ruled Leo, and we never, ever downplay Venus, smitten with every good thing she affords us. Sextile signs are of different modalities but the same polarity - - like people from neighboring nations with different cultures coming together to achieve a common goal. So incidentally, the gifts granted by the sextile are not automatically available to you like they are with the trine, and instead have to be discovered, explored, and cultivated.

In some ways, I feel this can be more powerful than the trine, the aspect lorded over by the greater benefic, Jupiter. Why? Because when blessings and talents are so readily given without being tempered by active cultivation, it can dampen the motivation to *work* towards something with those gifts. Hence the trine being associated with laziness. 

Imagine if you will, a person born into considerable wealth, having never needed to work for said wealth yet benefiting from it as their birthright. That would be akin to the trine, the greater gift. Now picture a person born into a middle or lower-class family, but possessing gifts that have the potential to accrue substantial wealth for the native IF they discover what those gifts are, and work towards cultivating them and bringing them to light. That is the sextile, the lesser gift. We tend to prefer the former, but the latter has its place. 

The sextile, like the trine, is a beneficial aspect, but comes with its own energy and blessings, not to be confused or combined with that of the trine. I believe sextiles are more important than what they are currently given credit for. And I feel that people should not gloss over their sextiles, but study them and work out the buried gifts and talents that they are promising.",4,20,2020-05-13 16:53:18,astrology

We tend to be less motivated to pursue traditional goals, and during this cycle we are more motivated to pursue spiritual or emotional motives. Energy levels can fluctuate from day to day, which depends on your emotional mood. Loneliness periods are required to recharge your energy.

On June 13, 2020, Mars will unite Neptune in Pisces, which can create several challenges in choosing action that you can struggle to determine what your real choice is; is to ensure that sufficient and continuous efforts are made to make the final decision to try to achieve them and then to ensure success. A non-integrated Neptune can make it difficult to maintain decisive clarity by resolving focused will. Try to stay honest as communication is vital in relationships.

Can an aspect not ‘count’ or is not as effective, when it comes to degrees?

What makes the sign of aries the point and not, say scorpio or whatever? Because it's the first sign? Even if it is, I'm not sure why everyone would have to start from it. Aren't the nodes supposed to be individual life points for everyone? What makes the aries node the starting point of all souls?

""Richard Tarnas (a professor of philosophy and depth psychology) in his important book “Cosmos and Psyche” suggests that the Saturn-Pluto cycle “coincides with especially challenging historical periods marked by a pervasive quality of intense contraction: eras of international crisis and conflict, empowerment of reactionary forces and totalitarian impulses, organized violence and oppression, all sometimes marked by lasting traumatic effects.”
...
Writing on the impact of the 1982 conjunction and a connection with the AIDS crisis – “An important characteristic set of Saturn-Pluto themes emerged in the collective psyche in the widespread rise in fundamentalist interpretations and moralistic judgments on the epidemic of God’s righteous punishment of sin.”

This phenomenon he says closely resembled the emergence of widspread views in medieval Europe when the bubonic plague was seen as the result of God’s wrath during the Saturn–Pluto conjunction of 1380-1340. And it was seen again during the conjunction when 9/11/2001 happened and Christian fundamentalists said it was God’s punishment for moral corruption.

“The positive potential of the Saturn-Pluto archetypal complex is usually inextricably intertwined with confronting its negative manifestations—great courage in the face of darkness, danger, and death; sustained effort and determination, intense focus and discipline; moral discernment and wisdom born from experience and suffering.”",8,18,2020-05-11 10:26:04,astrology

I'm here to play with the idea.

I'm an amateur and have been mostly reading myself and family for the past couple years with periods of deep learning and periods of totally forgetting astrology so bear with me.

I recently started researching it for my own chart and some of it really resonated hard with me. The parts about an overbearing mother couldn't be further from the truth which I think has to do with my moon being conjunct and in libra. But the part about how finances work in my life are eerily accurate.

[Ceres in detriment Scorpio](https://www.pandoraastrology.com/blog/ceres-detriment-scorpio/)

Again many of you have strong opinions on asteroids and how they are unnecessary and I respect your view but to me this was crazy accurate. 

I'd really like this conversation not to be about how it's unnecessary but rather the possibility. Another conversation point is whether Ceres should rule Virgo instead.

I've come to see Ceres as like earning your keep, reaping what you sow, the actions behind nurturing and being nurtured. Easy for me to grasp the relation between it and Taurus.",33,8,2020-05-10 12:02:58,astrology
1044,"In your experience, which planets/houses determine someone's likelihood of having an interest/belief in astrology? And which placements make people more or less open to astrology? When mentioning astrology in conversations, I can usually tell right away by people's responses how they feel about the topic. Some people seem open to astrology to some degree, whereas others flat out reject it and have no interest in discussing it.


In my experience, people with water placements in their charts (especially Scorpio and Pisces) are the most likely to be believers of astrology.


Folks with Leo and Libra placements seem to be open to discussing it and often take pride in the characteristics of their charts that they resonate with.


Earth-heavy people are often pretty skeptical and more likely to write it off as pseudoscience (Capricorn/Saturn/10th house energy especially).


People with Mercury-dominated charts, or a lot of 3rd house and 6th house energy (Gemini, Virgo) seem more likely to shut me down when I discuss it.


I've dated a few people with a lot of Aquarius in their charts and they always scoffed at me when I talked about astrology lol.


As for the houses, I would think that the position of planets/signs in the 9th house (philosophy) and 12th house (spirituality) would have some influence on this as well?

I set up a horary a chart a couple of days ago, asking if Trump will get re-elected.  I think it is clearly saying that he is going to lose in November, if he is on the ticket.  My analysis is here:

1058,"natal Scorpio energy and the downfall of Hillary, Joe Biden, and the Democrat Establishment. So I want to say that as someone who leans a bit too far left in politics, the current state of the Democrat party and the establishment tend to disappoint me. I mean, I was not surprised when Trump beat Hillary and will not be surprised when he defeats Biden quite decisively but this is less about politics, *more about astrology*. 

While any of us can look it up, here is the natal chart for Joe Biden:

https://astro-charts.com/persons/chart/joe-biden/

I cannot help but wonder that just like with Hillary, his downfall is going to be having such strong Scorpio energy in his chart and there is a reason for that. 

**Despite modern day astrologers, albeit with a strong bias, pointing to it as the strongest sign, Scorpios tend to struggle with direct confrontation, especially if it is a Mars in Scorpio.**

Think of it this way, a Mars in Scorpio is about *control*. If you do not question it or challenge it, then it can run things smoothly. You do not question why it does what it does, the mantra is *do as I say no as I do*. As a boss or a parent, a Scorpio Mars is phenomenal because it thrives in the positions of authority where nothing can be done to challenge it. When it is on equal footing? A Scorpio heavy chart relies on *behind the door* tactics and means to get ahead, it is different from a combative Aries mars. A Scorpio mars is more hidden, more subtle, and more behind the scenes.

Such is the modern day Democrat Establishment.

Vote for us or you are a racist, sexist, bigot, or (insert insulting word here). No objective reason to vote for us is highlighted, just that, *how can you not for vote for us*. Think of opposing a Scorpio heavy energy as a gasp, I mean, *how could you?*

How could you say that abusive parents who told you that you were no good and a piece of crap are bad parents? *You are supposed to respect your parents NO MATTER WHAT*.

How could you oppose our party? *You can't possibly like that racist, sexist, bigot, and shallow being can you?* Okay then? Support us!

Don't question, don't challenge, and don't resist. Accept us and bow!

It's almost like a sense of entitlement mixed in with virtue signaling and moral self-righteousness *going unchallenged* that lets such an energy thrive. Now I have nothing against Scorpios given that I qualify for having a stellium in the sign and have a Plutonian chart, hence my breakdown, but I guess I am not so out of touch to see weaknesses in the very energy I want to actually win.

**Against some candidates, particularly the traditional Republicans and the self-righteous, it could have worked.**

Against a Paul Ryan and the Republicans willing to play by the rules? It works.

A Jeb Bush or a Ted Cruz? It works.

A traditional goody two shoe caring about their status? It works.

Such candidates are prone to being insecure about how moral, nice, or good they are as people. Such people in general are prone to falling victim to a Scorpio Mars because a Scorpio energy *preys* on such people, it relies on their need to be seen a certain way in order to control them. Please the boss, play ""corporate politics"", and ""respect social norms"". Hence why a Scorpio Mars is considered powerful, it knows how to make you bend to your morality while toppling you and disrespecting you.

**Enter The Donald.**

While modern astrologers are hellbent on telling us all that Scorpios are some unstoppable force, I think a Scorpio energy's true weakness is *transparency* and *the lime light*. Scorpios work behind closed doors and away from public sight, they are the invisible hand. Now Trump is a Gemini with strong Leo energy to him, enter the kryptonite. Outside of Capricorn, I think that Leos and the Air Signs are the kryptonite of Scorpio energy and how so?

It's simple, they make you go against them *in the open*. Now a Bernie Sanders type of energy that is maybe radical but transparent could fare quite well against Trump because Bernie stands for something. The Scorpio energy of Biden is simply just trying to get the presidency, no matter how much you have to bend your beliefs and values to do it.

Yet, Gemini is communication, it is the news media that exposes a celeb's dirty secrets. You can only hide from it and cover up your trucks until it finds out. Leo? Well, Leo is domiciled by the Sun and the sun is the self. Leo is the crazy friend you have who can somehow own up to being a crazy friend and make it look cool. In other words, what you see is what you get. 

Most of all, a Leo can OWN their personality to the masses, they put them at ease. Now this is why Obama was such a favorable candidate to the Democrats, it was due to his Leo energy radiating a trust in the masses that Scorpio energy cannot. Scorpio is control through whatever means, even if (and usually) dishonest and totalitarian. 

Now how does Leo defeat Scorpio? While Gemini lifts up the skirt of a Scorpio and shows its hypocrisy, a Leo easily outshines and wins people over. Leos are your favorite teacher while Scorpios are the teachers that scared you into liking them. Angered enough? A Leo will easily use their charisma and strong tone to point out the flaws in a Scorpio everyone saw but was too scared to point out.

**Why it is even worse in this age.**

We live in an age of transparency and communication which was not always the case back in the day when elections could be rigged without media attention. Now, candidates *have* to answer for past gaffes and past mistakes even moreso. As the age of Aquarius approaches, this will get even worse, you cannot hide. 

Now I think that by picking more honest and open candidates who can own up to their personality and foolish flaws, Democrats can win the White House in the future. I do not think Hillary or Joe are those candidates.",61,67,2020-05-09 10:42:26,astrology

This is a very important week in astrology because of this full moon.  It brings about energies of death and rebirth; major transformation can take place through deep purging.

So, now is an opportunity to let go of the weight of the past and everything else you don't want in your life anymore.  This can be people, relationships, jobs, creers, friends, material items, habits, routines, and even your state of mind.

1088,"Astrology for the state of Georgia, what if attitudes of the collective in an area can be shown by its potential chart? As you all may be aware, the state of Georgia is in the news again for the wrong reasons, *surprisingly* its racism. Now I lived in the south for a good portion of my life and while racism is an issue moreso down there compared to other areas of the country, I always got the feeling that something about Georgia was maybe different. I think something about all of the states is different but I thought to myself, what if we did a Natal Chart for the states and then evaluated a bit.

**Well it was tricky as heck!**

While as a COLONY Georgia was founded on February 12, 1733, it was recognized as a state in the info listed below.

Now research tells me that Georgia was founded on January 2, 1788. Initially, the best I could do was find this source which says that Georgia is a Capricorn Sun with a Scorpio Moon, see below!

http://wisdom-magazine.com/Article.aspx/416/

No matter what Georgia cities you look at, TONS of Capricorn energy.

Initially, I tried doing a natal chart for Georgia but it was very very tough. The reason is, I do not have the exact birth time of the state which means the rising and midheaven signs would be off along with other signs. The one I did do had a Mars in Cancer and Aquarius Venus but we are going to leave that out for now.

Even with the Capricorn Sun and Scorpio Moon, I ended up realizing just how Georgia was different from other southern states I was in and how it reflected on the overall population I knew there. 

**Digging down into my experience in Georgia.**

Before Georgia, I had lived in various southern states and it was different. People were ""nice"" and they were very down to earth, it was almost a genuine type of niceness in those places. The one trend I always saw in Georgia whether I was in Athens or Atlanta? The constant need to **climb** the social ladder and be popular. I noticed how appearances, perception, and how the world saw you mattered more to the people in Georgia than other southern states I was in. You were only wanted company if you helped others get ahead.

Whether it was the music and film scene in Atlanta or the church appearances scene in the suburbs, it was all about, *how do you help me get ahead*. Social politics were cut-throat and everyone wanted to get ahead, it was all about the outward success of some kind whether it was the trophy wife, popularity status, or fancy house.

**Tying it into Capricorn.**

People might initially say that it is actually a very Leo thing to want all that. Well, I find that Leos are not as materialistic as Capricorns, they are more so driven by a need to prove something to themselves and the world. A Capricorn values getting ahead without much regard for the feelings of others, different from Leos who actually do take that into account because they care more about how they are seen and perceived based on things *other* than just their material success. 

To a Capricorn, it is always about appearances but different from how it is for a Leo. A Leo sees themselves as a Gladiator that want the battle, the world cheers for the victor and throws rewards at them. A Capricorn sees success differently, it's about being the victor no matter what the world thinks, you climb to the top then who cares if they like you or not, *you're a the top*. Let the other things about you hide, just get your success.

Plus, Capricorn is associated with the planets of Saturn and exalted in the sign of Mars.

**The Scorpio Moon.**

The Moon is in an unfavorable position in Scorpio, the reason I find is because Scorpio moons tend to hide their feelings and show a tough exterior. Time and time again, I see this with Scorpios in general, the need to be perceived as powerful while really just hiding the inner weaknesses that might be there. Now I saw this play out in Georgia with materialism, that heavy desire for fame among the locals (more-so than other parts of the south and even America), and the need to play high school popularity games well after high school.

You almost felt like there was a tight social leash in Georgia, you couldn't cuss without someone seeing it as a social sin and everyone was walking around social eggshells in a way. Such is the Scorpio moon coming out, that need to control what others say and do so you can have power over them. Meanwhile, do your damage behind the scenes and try to challenge the moral character of other people.

**Social trend and the future.**

A recent murder of a black man went unnoticed and it was only after a video was shown was something done about it. Again, it wasn't done because of care, it was done because it could ruin the reputation of an entire area even more, especially given the supposed social strides its city Atlanta made as being so ""progressive"" and a Mecca for black America. 

I think that as Georgia becomes more influential as a state and Atlanta grows as a city, especially given how big film culture is there, we will see it. We will see if the area is one of substance or a plastic city with fancy buildings and events compared to a city like New Orleans, Austin, or NYC which have character.",26,10,2020-05-08 11:57:50,astrology

1091,"The Astrology of Weight Loss ft. Adele Kinda going out on a limb here, so this can be more a discussion. Also, this post has nothing to do with my opinions on her weight loss, or her weight at all. No value judgments. Just objective observations ft. astrology.

I don't see diet talked about much here so here goes..

1) Some predispositions for indulgence/weight issues for Adele: Sun conj Jupiter in Taurus (Lizzo has this as well), and Moon in Sag. Much is said of the Taurus appetite, but Jupiter is the planet of true indulgence, going overboard, etc. Now put all that in Taurus... Her Moon in Sag (Jupiter again) is also in her 6th house of diet. Her 2nd house (which rules over material possession and sustenance i.e. food) is Leo, ruled over by this Sun. So there is a theme of using food to feel secure, deriving confidence from 2nd house themes. Jupiter/Sun also opposes Pluto, so eating for a sense of control.

2) Adele started her weight loss journey during her Saturn Return, as all big changes tend to happen during this period! Her natal chart, rated B (so more than likely reliable), has her Saturn in Cap in the 7th sitting in a direct opposition to her ASC in Cancer. So anything that happens to Saturn invariably affects her appearance as well. Adele also celebrated a divorce during this period, freeing her up to work on herself. Saturn is the planet of restriction, and its transits have a lot to do with weight loss. Thin and grim planet.

3) Adele was in a 6th house profection year when she started her weight loss journey, finished a 7th and 8th house year, and is now in a 9th house year, having celebrated her 32nd bday a few days ago. The 6th house year is where we can establish new health routines. Her ruler of the 6th, Jupiter conj. her Sun, and her Moon, in Sag, were all planets at play. The Moon being comfort, Sun being identity, and Jupiter being excess--perhaps Adele had a realization about her health and weight and her relationship to food. The Sun in the mix, very visible in the 11th, means, of course, opinions from the public at large about her. Her weight loss is very much an identity overhaul, for better and worse.

*Everyone undergoing their Saturn Return experiences a 6th house year. That is why Saturn Returns often become about getting better, healthier, and establishing productive habits. That is why Saturn Returns are also often about responsibility and duty--themes of the 6th. Planets and rulers of the 6th very by chart, as do the flavors of the SR.*

3 cont'd) Adele's 7th house year was a compounding activation of Saturn. She was in her SR, in a Capricorn 7th year, with Saturn in Capricorn. With Mars in Aquarius, Mars was also activated because Saturn rules Aquarius. Mars adds in the willpower component,. It also trines her Venus, so the pursuits of Mars aid in feeling beautiful for her. And then when she entered her 8th house year, Mars was activated again, ruling over her 5th house Scorpio (remember her Pluto Jupe opposition above), and her 10th house Aries. Her 8th house year, 2019, is when she would show off her results, posting sporadically to Instagram. That's a 10th house activation. Maybe the 5th house activation is that she was always photographed at parties, at the beach, and just having hella fun.

4) Adele has Venus in Gemini opposite her Moon in Sag. That's kind of an obvious indicator that her relationship to food and her sense of beauty and esteem are always at odds. She's stated that she's felt very insecure about her weight. Venus in the 12th can also be why her love life is often very private, but also why she chose to undergo this transformation privately. Some celebrities opt for the all-in show n tell approach.

5) She lost weight with the Sirtfood Diet. This is just so hilarious to me. This diet allows red wine, dark chocolate, olive oil, and other very rich foods. DO NOT TAKE AWAY WINE AND CHOCOLATE FROM A TAURUS!!! These are all foods that contain the protein sirtuin. Sirtuins work on the body's inflammation response (Jupiter Venus tings). Its reportedly ""inspired by nature"" and also includes foods such as kale, walnuts, barely, coffee--aka things that grow from earth. Very Taurus. 

6) The Nodes. The North Node in Cancer was transiting her 1st house, while the SN in Capricorn was transiting her 7th. The clear manifestation of this was her divorce. But NN playing in the 1st is a growing sense of confidence. The Cancer seeps in with care and nurturing of yourself, which can be done through food and activity and health, but also an intangible self-love. Cancer is also a vulnerable place, so her posting pictures of herself was an act of bravery, especially for a celebrity. Putting more emphasis on who you are as in individual versus who you are in a relationship. SN in Capricorn for her could also mean retreat from public life, as Capricorn can be where we accomplish and do business things. 

All the best to her xx",23,59,2020-05-07 23:49:45,astrology

I know it's a combination of energies i.e. scorpio/ plutonian vibe etc etc. Those who have an intense vibe, know who they are- how do you navigate in life?

I am one of those people so when at work I try and get on with the task at hand and put my full energy/ attention on it but just want to know how others manage it.

What experiences have you had? Like for instance- because of the intense and at times fascinating energy I put out I often find people try to garner your attention. Regardless of what type it is, they would try and get your attention, whether that's negative or positive. Like people trying to get a response out of you constantly and can get a bit draining.

1102,"Super Flower Full Moon Full flower moon
Super Full Moon will take place today on May 7 at 13:45 17 ° Scorpio.
Whether passion, joy, sadness or desire, emotions are felt on a very personal level. Superficiality will no longer work for us. The Moon in Scorpio calls on us to reveal our own strength, and it's the perfect time to get rid of old fears and limiting habits.
In other parts of the world, Full Flower Moon is known as Vesak or Buddha Day, the most important celebration for Buddhists. In the first full moon of May, Buddhists commemorate the birth, enlightenment and passage of the Buddha. Religious practitioners are encouraged to renew any intentions of killing and violence, including eating meat, as well as to renew their intention to comply with sacred Buddhist principles. Celebrations include giving charity to poor, disabled and otherwise excluded groups in the community. Depending on your location, you can witness the wonderful application of releasing thousands of caged birds as a symbolic liberation movement into the air, but this tradition is illegal in countries like Singapore, because it can damage local ecosystems.

Pagans, on the other hand, associate the Moon embellished with Flowers with the element of fire, and therefore often celebrates by burning bonfires and participating in other magical fire rituals to bring prosperity. Powerful colors for ""Full Flower Moon"" include fiery colors like red, yellow, and orange. It is a good time to arrange your garden and let the seeds you plant both bloom literally and figuratively.

That’s the energy of Gemini NN to me haha.

On a societal level...

SN in Sagittarius: end of my way or highway soap-boxing, end of dogmatic thinking being accepted as Truth, the illusion of fake news lifting, losses to the way we travel globally, less my way or the high way

NN in Gemini: fact over philosophy and theorizing, able to hold many ideas at once, expanding on the ability to change your mind, common sense, letting new information in

In general, SN Sag is the archetype of a well-traveled and knowledgeable sage, in whatever field, seeking to share what they know. This archetype appears to know it all, about everything, and will make sure you know that. The plus side is what this placement does indeed have a lot to share. The downside is that they don’t listen to other people, factor in the details, and have a hard time separating their ego from their smarts. Marco Polos.

NN Gemini is seeking to be that better listener, to siphon through all the relevant details and facts, to be comfortable learning from others. This placement is community oriented and less about traveling far and wide. Time to be in the present moment, here and now, what matters this second.

On a personal level...

It depends a lot on what houses Sag and Gemini are for you. And if there are planets there.

My basic approach: SN DRAIN, NN GAIN.

So wherever the NN is where we can experience gains, and wherever the SN is where we can experience drains.

Here are some ideas to get you thinking.

**ARIES ASC**: gains in the third house, drains in the ninth. a period of community oriented endeavors, of letting new ideas permeate your daily life. less lusting after faraway places and lofty mindsets, but letting the here and now spark wonder

**TAURUS ASC**: gains in the second, drains in the eighth. personal income from your own personal endeavors. make right with what you owe people and get your head around your debt. retooling your beliefs around money and possession.

**GEMINI ASC**: gains in the first house, drains in the seventh. a period of coming into your own without seeing other people as a necessity in that journey. speaking up for yourself, face forward now, retooling which relationships are needed and which you can jettison

**CANCER ASC**: gains in the twelfth, drains in the sixth. the daily habits or jobs that once sustained you are becoming beige boring or broken. looking towards the metaphysical to bring back a sense of magic and wonder, and letting that seep into your routines

**LEO ASC**: gains in the eleventh, drains in the fifth. less about what personally makes you feel good and more about what you can bring to the community to make them feel good. creation needs an audience, be it a piece of work, art, a child or yourself. you may make lifelong friends and associates, time to find your tribe. mingle

**VIRGO ASC**: gains in the tenth, drains in the fourth. volume is turned up on your place on the world stage. opportunities to bolster your sense of purpose will be abound. you may have to say goodbye to staying small or staying hidden, and bloom past what your family expects of you. an end of the comfort zone.

**LIBRA ASC**: gains in the ninth, drains in the third. a period of travel, whether journeys of the mind or journeys in real life. commit knowing all there is to know and seeing all there is to see and practicing all there is to practice. this will expand your horizons. true wisdom requires time and a nimble mind. spiritual passages await

**SCORPIO ASC**: gains in the eighth house, drains in the second. your sense of personal insecurity will be made up for by the graciousness of others. a period of true sharing, investment, and resourceful intimacy. the ways that you waste money or valuables (your time and energy and patience too) will become apparent, and asking for help from others is your best bet

**SAG ASC**: gains in the seventh house, drains in the first. a period of relationships that can help you reevaluate who you are and where you’re going. not the loss of self sufficiency per se, but the ability to let others co-pilot this stretch

**CAP ASC**: gains in the sixth, drains in the twelfth. time to be more real world oriented. the isolation that serves you, the spiritual practices that unnerve you, these are to keep and help you become better in life, on the job, and for others. all the other psychic chatter, alienation, trauma, sabotage that does not bolster you must go. break down to build up, not to stay broken. this opens up new ways to be of service, to remain flexible in your duties, and to remain childlike and light as you approach each day

**AQUA ASC**: gains in the fifth, drains in the eleventh. social exhaust. extraneous friends. arsenals of acquaintances. groups and beliefs you have grown out of. time to spring clean your social networks. a true sense of belonging comes from authenticity of self, and all else that spring from that. opportunities for pleasure, joy, art, creation, romance and love remind you who you are and who is worth keeping around. your own best friend.

**PISCES ASC**: gains in the fourth, drains in the tenth. a place for solid roots, a home, a family. these are all themes that are of concern. it is less important that you be respected by the world, by your colleagues, than it is that you have a place to relax and retreat, to feel safe and secure, to delight in the smaller successes of comfort, a family dinner, a mortgage in your name, and a place to lay your head. you step down from an authority figure, and are content to just feel content. your mom, your dad, your home.

NOTE that the drain/gain paradigm isn’t black and white. There won’t be complete losses in one area so don’t expect that. Rather, a clearing up, drain, allows for the gains to have space to settle in. For example, Gemini rising draining of relationships that don’t serve gives Gemini rising the space to come into their own. Doesn’t mean all relationships are doomed.

The SN and NN work in tangent. No need to completely ignore or abhor or fear one in service of the other. The SN is the launching pad. The NN is where we go once launched.

Also remember that the Sag/Gem axis is one that is inherently cerebral in nature. It deals a lot with the mind. So Gemini information gather versus Sag ""I know it all"" is what is fundamentally at play here. At the end of this period, you will **KNOW** more about what there is for you to learn i.e. these changes could, for some, play out entirely in your brain. ",119,308,2020-05-06 00:52:06,astrology

1151,"Easily explaining the difference in what sign a planet is in, versus what house a planet is in, versus your placidus (lines up which house each sign is in starting with your ascendant) DISCLAIMER: I am not an expert, this is simply my way of trying to make sense of all this, based on my experience, and my circle of influence and individuals charts I've been able to look at and evaluate.

So my theory or thought on the matter is as follows. Placidus outlines someone's value structure, and is one of the more predictive astrological tools, because it sort of characterizes your houses with the energy of the sign that lies within(example scorpio is the sign of transformation, scorpio in the 2nd house, 2nd house deals with wealth and possessions, therefore someone would predict a major shift or transformation dealing with that individuals wealth or possessions simple enough) crazy enough I've found a lot of predictive aspects of the placidus to line up.

Okay now the house a planet is in. In my experience the house a planet is in indicates the way a person thinks of that part of life and that part of their personality. Ask someone to describe themselves, they will most likely describe from the point of view the house the planet is in. Example I'm Virgo sun, but my sun is in the 11th house I've always felt the need to rebel, and to look out for the people at a disadvantage, I still think in this way despite knowing that lines up more with the 11th house which is the house aligned with Aquarius. Importance of this being how someone will see themselves versus how they are seen.

Lastly and most prevalent the Sign a planet is in is the true characterization of the individual. So as the house tells what lies beneath the sign a planet is in tells you how that part of you truly manifests in the world. The importance of this being it may be the hardest pill to swallow, we inherently do not see ourselves clearly, therefore connecting with the true energy of the sign a planet lies in is very difficult but will inevitably allow us to realize the full potential of that part of ourselves.

Okay that was long but tell me what you think and your thought process behind the importance of these 3 major aspects of your chart.",4,4,2020-05-06 02:28:53,astrology

1154,"Something curious I've noticed on the discovery of Ceres I was studying Ceres, its symbolism, and anything I could find about it, just to understand it better. Now, an unbalanced Ceres, I read, may bring to a ""smothering"" or ""devouring"" mother, like the nurturing and the care and the attention is so much that the mother grows too attached to the child and cannot let them go, to the point of suffocation.

If we look up the moment of the discovery of Ceres, [like here](https://www.astro.com/cgi/chart.cgi?wgid=wgeJyFTssKwjAQ_BpvK-ShtDTkIBVE8eBBEI9bu9hgkkqSWvL3pvgBsocZ5sHsbF5GC_V0GrnyvW7JUkwGbbMSrKVAseDexMf4oZABCPhyNeMgWLOR4LgkIeCJFhhc0FJwIxyvu_Mdfo6sPatgAlFVpSPlFpjCvvPo6M_aEusxkeZFPaGfMOTClnHVpfwuf7s0aEyzGmLWa65C1Px2-AK34kEJ) we can see that Ceres was at 23° 23' in Taurus at the moment (not visible in the link I posted, I had to look it up), and Saturn was square to it and in retrograde.

Looking up the myth behind Saturn, or Chronos in the Greek tradition, he was the father who literally ate his children because he was afraid they would substitute him. The parental figures are opposite (mother Vs father, of course talking of archetypes here), the act is the same, but one is figurative the other is real, the motives are mirrored (not wanting to see the child grow, one fears separation, the other fears competition. Again, I see a mirroring in the archetypes of father Vs mother, of masculine Vs feminine).

Just a thought.

Good leaders if they mature.

Aries is very bossy. Lots of energy and always trying to move things along so don't get in their way or they will forcibly move you. They don't like lazy people or people who don't take action. They are drill sergeants. Cardinal.

Leo is very bossy and a fire sign like Aries but Leo thinks it's the king. Leo thinks people should bow down and follow their superior command. In their mind no one is more worthy to lead. They got the VIP or celebrity mentality.

Cancer is a bossy sign. People think Cancer is always crying but no, Cancer actually has a strong shell and they like to manage people. If they think they know what's best they will tell you what to do like a parent would to a child. Den mother. Cardinal.

Virgo is bossy in a similar way to Cancer but more critical and specific. Once they decide what your weaknesses are and how you can improve them that's it, they will make it their mission to boss you around and make you get your act together. They don't like incompetence.

Capricorn is bossy and controlling. They don't accept second best so will push you and themselves. They like to delegate to people and they like to feel they have authority over people. Cardinal.

1206,"DOES PLUTO REPRESENT TRANSFORMATION? one of the top buzzwords associated with Pluto is “transformation.” I’ve also heard similar terms like “regeneration” or “resurrection,” all of which represent the idea of metamorphosis or personal evolution.⁣

much of the symbolism that has been attached to Pluto is due to the ABC system, aka the idea that Pluto = Scorpio = the 8th house. imo, using these three components of astrology (planets, signs, houses) &amp; meshing them into one has really diluted our understanding of their individual significations. in this case, the concept of Scorpio &amp; transformation were inherently attributed to Pluto.⁣

I think some modern astrology has tried to paint Pluto in a more positive light. I associate Pluto with crises, power, destruction, death, as well as the deepest &amp; darkest parts of our psyche: our compulsions, our manipulative tendencies, &amp; dichotomized thinking. these definitions are all different iterations of trauma.⁣

but trauma doesn’t inherently equal transformation.⁣

it’s an important distinction, as I believe Pluto represents the crises that can destroy us or force us to regenerate. ⁣

if we assume personal growth &amp; healing are an inevitable outcome of Pluto, it discounts the conscious &amp; ever-consuming effort one takes to transform the self. in addition, it disregards the fact that not everyone has the resources to aid mental, physical, or spiritual healing. access to time off work, therapy, spiritual guides, etc. are a privilege that aren’t available to all. many individuals live in survival mode. ⁣

Pluto being emblematic of transformation undermines the concept of autonomy &amp; disregards our role in how our birth chart manifests.⁣

we are all capable of growth, but we must acknowledge that our birth chart is both a illustration of our highest potential &amp; a map of the forces that exist outside of our control.⁣

Pluto is our power to change, but Pluto is also the societal powers that bind &amp; oppress us.",4,8,2020-05-03 05:32:37,astrology
1207,"Another way of conceptualizing natal chart interpretations -- Personifying the planets and the placements. What does Mercury's house look like? Literally, his actual house. It's probably full of different tools of from different fields -- like various scientific equipment, books on different subjects, writing utensils, scholarly articles. Maybe there's a telephone on the wall, a TV flipping channels, access to the internet -- it's full of potential pathways of interest. Mercury likes to keep busy and stay informed, and experiment with new knowledge, so these are the things he fills he house with.

If Mercury's house (3rd house) is under the sign of the Capricorn constellation, maybe the house is surrounded by high mountains right at sunrise, inspiring accomplishment and aspirations. The structure of the mountains are reminiscent of tradition and order, and their ancient age reminds us of our karmic fates. This is the atmosphere that the 3rd house is residing in here.

And who's here, visiting Mercury's house (3rd house), under the Capricorn stars (in Capricorn)? Why, Mars is passing through. How does forceful and powerful Mars interact with the objects in Mercury's house? How is he influenced by the environment of Capricorn? He sees the tools of interest and education laying around, and the stars fill him with an energy to make something out of it all. And with Mar's red, pulsing energy, he is driven to do a lot with the tools here in the 3rd house! Sure, he might get a little frustrated and tear the place up, but with the right help from his neighbors, he may very well be able to build something great with the tools Mercury left.

\------

I've been struggling with understanding how the planets, constellations, and houses exert their energy in their unique ways on the native. When I started thinking of the planets as actual beings, with desires, personality traits, and a will of their own, it helped me a lot. Maybe it can help you too?

Think about what each planet might be like if they were personified. What would their houses/dwellings be like? What would their home constellation look like as a natural environment?

Now put more than one planet in a specific house. How do they interact with each other in that environment? 

And then to think about the aspects -- Neptune can see Moon across the way waving at him --- they are at a harmonious angle, so the Moon is always sending Neptune smiles and good vibes from her house across the chart. They are at a good angle to each other.

But Pluto, he sees the sun over there, around the block, he hates that guy. He's always sending dirty looks around the corner. How do their energies clash at that hard angle?",11,140,2020-05-02 10:45:13,astrology

1222,"Hello Ophiuchus

Stage 9 – OPHIUCHUS – November 30 to December 17

Alchemical Theme: Unification, Wound Healing

Element: Water/Aether

Themes

Creatrix connectivity, Pure Transparent Crystalline Light, Divine Mother and the cleansing power of cosmic love, recoding the DNA, Aligning to th cosmic heart of Lyra in Andromedan Universal Center and The Aurora Re-encryption latticeworks, Rebirthing, Cleansing the blood, breath, and Mitochondria. Purification of past traumas. recollecting memories from alternate timelines and resurrecting harmony to the monadic station of identity and resonating into embodiment stages of the christ-sophia blueprint, energy-architecture, and flows of living unity. Clearing connections to The Silver Gate system and wave spectrum of the metatronic and nephilim mind. Releasing hybridzation and galactic war trauma, removal of Victim-Victimizer archontic deception mind programming. Preparation for integration of the solar mind RA consciousness. Activation of triwave geomantic reconfigrations.

Constellation

The constellation Ophiuchus is known as the “Serpent Holder” and sits 180 degrees across from the Orion constellation (Osiris). The Orion constellation sits in the opposite direction, which would be considered the anti-galactic center. Ophiuchus and Orion are mirror images of opposing polarity. Together, they represent the ascending path through the Gate of Man meeting at the Gate of Gods. The many Ascension Stages we endure to reach our spiritual Magnum Opus, are the stages of humanity moving through these sequences of consciousness gateways. We all incarnate as earthly beings that evolve through the Precession of the Equinoxes. This takes us through the consciousness realms moving through the ecliptic path of the Gate of Man to eventually complete the evolution cycle, which intersects at the Galactic Center. Once we unify the consciousness experiences through the Gate of Man intersecting with the Galactic Equator at Ophiuchus’ feet, we are potentially given access to The Golden Gate. This allows us to proceed on the Ascension path to become resurrected eternal spiritual beings unified with the Cosmic Holy Spirit.

Alchemy

This phase is the solar alignment with the Cosmic Aether which is at the core of the Galactic Center, which represents pouring of healing spiritual waters into the earth and humanity from Mother God. Previously, these waters were corrupted by entrapping the Mother principle and Gold Ray Seraphim on earth by the knowledge coveting Serpent. Hence, this is also the symbol for the Fallen Angel. This is why this constellation is both ruled by the Golden Eagle spirit and the Snake. During the ascension cycle this constellation is to return to its original geometry, to represent the union of all polarity as the perfect blueprint of energetic balance and harmony for humanity. Through the embodiment of this energetic balance into perfected unity, in the upcoming Pisces cycle, the knowledge and wisdom is given back to the truth seeker. Therefore, in its highest expression this constellation represents the potential blueprint of divine perfection in a Human Being. It also represents the pending birth of the Christ child growing in the womb of the Divine Mother. It is one with all things and has no opposite. It is capable of healing all human wounds and amplifies spiritual healing in this cycle. It is related to the symbol Phi and reemerging Sophia.

Ophiuchus is the Trine Unifier

In addition with the Ophiuchus transmissions, the divine fire water element acts as the trine and unifier between each of the squares in the combinations of four constellation groupings that make up the cardinal signs, fixed signs and mutable signs. In the previous cycles, the spiritual Blueprint of humanity included many squares and oppositions in the birth imprint from certain planetary or constellation conjunctions that generated disharmony, discordance and distress. These oppositional forces placed limitations upon the spirit, and resulted in a variety of spiritual oppressions, miasmatic patterns and karmic burdens. It is similar to say that squares, oppositions and limitations that are recorded in the geometries of the spiritual blueprint can be understood in the birth chart, and are the result of the consequences of actions, unlearned lessons, spiritual purpose and the debts of destiny that have been carried throughout multiple lifetimes. The earth body also has its own blueprint that is made up from the Collective Consciousness records of humanity, so when incarnating into a timeline on the earth, we are also imprinted with the karmic burdens of the collective consciousness imprint at the time of incarnation.

It is also accurate to say that the NAA had control over aspects of the twelve constellation transmissions, which had resulted in more extreme negative polarities in the world of forces, in order to achieve their intended objective of control over matter forms. They intended to radically to hide the 13 the 13 zodiac from you.

1287,"Stages of Development. EDIT: To be clear - I’m talking about the energy association of each sign and not characteristics (although can manifest strongly for some people) of individual people. 

Hi everyone, 

I was recently describing to a friend, how I think of each block of 4 elements in the Zodiacal wheel as stages of development. The untested, the testing and the tested. It helps me with my tarot practice to context them this way so that I can add a deeper layer of meaning to the feeling of say, The Hierophant - the establishment of personal belief and desire. And then how that connection to your belief relates to your desires, with TH being ruled by Taurus which are both, in turn, rule by Venus. With this falling under The untested, this is a discovery exercise more so than a centring process. This is something to be planted rather than tended. I hope that makes the thought clear enough. 

So this set me on a thought path of mapping out these stages more clearly in my mind and yesterday, I wrote it down for the first time. 

I  wanted to share it with you all and see what you had to say.  Follows: 

The Untested:

Aries - The need
Taurus - The desire 
Gemini - The idea 
Cancer - The feeling 

The Testing: 

Leo - The strength 
Virgo - The analysis 
Libra - The balance 
Scorpio - The determination 

The Tested:

Sagittarius - The passion 

Capricorn - The structure 
Aquarius - The intellect
Pisces - The understanding

1289,"Understanding the uniqueness of Earth element? Hey,

I'm a very earth dominant person, however if I had to explain what earth represents, I'm not sure I could.
From what I know, here is how I see the other elements:

Air - logical and rationalists basically, less into emotions. Can fit into jobs with emphasis on community and socialism such as social workers, journalists, reporters, etc.

Water - tend to be more emotional and prefer to think and act in terms of emotions rather than of pure rationalism. May do well with occupations with emphasis on emotions or relating to their inner world - like art, where they can express themselves.

Fire - enjoy the energetic drive, the action and the power. Attitude is, less matters what to do, more important is simply to do! May fit in jobs including thrills, fighting and competitions, like in the army, in sports, traveling, etc.

Now with Earth is where I struggle. Are they considered more emotional like Water, more rational like Air, or just in the middle? Are they a mixture of the other elements? What kind of occupations would describe them best as opposed to the other signs?

Can anyone SINGLE THEM OUT?

1299,"3rd House I saw someone post this about the 11th House, and having a 3rd House stellium of 4 planets here myself, I figured i'd pose the question to see if anyone else has this type of placement (or meaningful placements to them) and/or what it means for you personally? I've seen varied significations for this house. These range from the following:

* siblings and other distant family 
* communication 
* ""mind"" or ""perception""
* introductory coursework or ""general"" studies ('jack of all trades')
* driving 
* neighbors
* being a heretic, or ""having a voice.""

I can see why it relates to heresy, being opposite the 9th house of Temples/Churches. I guess i'll comment on that. My moon is here and I believe that our own body is our own sanctuary/temple, so I do NOT feel that it is necessary to go to churches or temples or mosques to pray. I've also spent a large part of my life challenging ""organized religion"" to begin with, though I do understand how it is beneficial for some people. I certainly don't consider myself an atheist, but very spiritual. I also see a big difference between using placidus and whole sign when it comes to this house, maybe moreso than in other houses. One of the main reasons I use placidus in addition to whole signs is because my natal Mars makes more sense being here (its 4H in whole sign), because I am very argumentative about my points and I process information better when i'm moving. I also have Uranus in this house so my points tend to be eccentric to begin with. But Neptune here usually softens both and helps me communicate poetically, but I tend to get lost easily. I feel like Whole sign is better for more objective analysis (ex: Saturn in 3rd may mean no siblings). 

Please don't take this post to be a question about myself, I just want to know what the 3rd house means for you and how it may potentially manifest in your life if you have placements there. Thanks!",32,5,2020-04-29 07:01:56,astrology

In general, I understand that the ideas of masculine and feminine follow from the cosmic principles of positive and negative – outward and inward, give and take – but I have never understood the wont of people to use masculine and feminine in the context of astrology. Does gendering the cosmos this way not seem sort of patriarchal? Especially when plenty of people, especially spiritual people, understand that the balance of positive energy and negative energy traits in a person doesn’t have anything to do with their gender or their sex, I don’t understand why astrologers tend to apply that bias to the cosmos. It always just seems like reinforcing old gender norms when astrologers describe the nurturing, emotional, changeable energy of the Moon as feminine when nothing is inherently female or male (or non-binary, for that matter) about those traits, especially while the much more universal word, negative, is right there waiting to be used.

Here we have Pluto reaching almost the end of Capricorn, and it feels like we're all rushing with relief to move on to the Aquarian waters and be done with this intense Saturnian inquisition. 

I see this reflected so well in how the states and world are planning - some literally on the same day of the station - to open back up again. I see the protests indicating that we're ready to be done. We can feel it, how close it is to transition into something new. 

Only now we regress and step backwards into it all again, but we're gonna be in deep hard intense denial about that as we continue to try to move forward. Even as all the other planets follow suit and it really hits home.

Can't help but see how much we're going to need to learn some major lessons in the coming months before the autumn brings us back into forward momentum again. 

More and more the idea of this being the big shift forward into the Aquarian age seems quite apt, and those equalizing ideals have little room for privatized interests and narcissistic manipulations. It seems the deep pluto-cap restructuring is beginning.

1327,"The Astrology of the Atlanta Child Murders ft. Wayne Williams HBO is running a great docu-series on this case right now. It was also the main plot point on the 2nd season of Netflix's *Mindhunter.*

Basically, from 1979 to 1981, 28 black children, adolescents, and youngish adults were killed in Atlanta.  Wayne Williams was/is the alleged murderer, but they only got him on the 2 deaths of the older victims. So essentially, there are 26 unsolved child murders. Did Wayne do it? Did he not? I think he did, speculatively. Sadly, the living relatives of these children are in continual anguish, as Williams was never tried for their murders. No one was.

So what is the Astrology behind it all, specifically Wayne Williams?

To start--Williams was very aware that he was a Gemini. He was an amateur music executive/manager/person and had a band called *Gemini.* He was known to kind of lovingly lament that he had ""two sides"".  I am presenting here that, yes, he did have two sides. And with a Virgo ASC and Moon, probably an infinite amount of sides.

Dude was VERY mercurial.

Dude was VERY mutable.

His birth chart is rated **A.**

Look up a picture of Wayne Williams. That's a textbook Virgo Rising. Bookish and nerdy looking. Unassuming. Always in a collared shirt and slacks. His Virgo affect would put many off to his ability to commit heinous acts. He was simply too geeky to pull it off, they assumed. To hear Williams talk, you can suss the Virgo out too. Very well-spoken.

He had a very ardent interest in broadcasting and journalism. He had a police radio in his car so he could hear about crimes immediately after they happened, and then he would rush off to take pictures and be the first one on the scene. He became somewhat of a rookie investigator, and police and broadcast personnel knew him well. Later, he would even rush to the scenes of crimes that he allegedly committed. Williams had his Sun in Gemini placed in his 10th conjunct his MC. He also had his NN conjunct Neptune in the 3rd house in Scorpio. He was positioned not only to seek recognition from his community news gathering (Gemini), but the 3rd house Scorpio also rendered those happenings sordid in nature. Rushing to the scenes of fires, of murders, of accidents, etc. There was something uniquely dark about the information he sought to disseminate. With a strong 10th house Sun and Neptune right on top of his soul-desire, Williams delusionally went after fame in his community. Neptune is a glamour-making agent, and there is nothing more glamorous than being recognized, than being made authority over something. Only clearly Williams went after it in less-than-realistic and downright insane ways. That police radio? Didn't stop there. Williams paraded around in his car and often pretended to be a cop, some say, to lure his victims in. (RX Saturn in fall in Sagittarius in the 4th--his sense of authority--trine Pluto in Leo in the 12th---an immense personal will a sense of purpose, but perverted and stunted)

In addition to his sleuthing, Williams was fond of music. He owned a radio station. His Mercury was in beauty and music loving Taurus and exactly trined his ASC (sweet talker, able to convince). He handed out fliers to young children with artistic promise, saying that he could turn them into the next Michael Jackson. That's a HIGH return on investment. Maybe even delusional, you'd say? Oh, Neptune opposite Venus in Aries, out of sign. But also, Venus opposite Jupiter in Libra. Venus ruling over that Taurus Mercury, in fall in Aries, opposite dreamy Neptune and boastful Jupiter. Dude had a massively inflated ego and wildly unrealistic expectations.

In the 8th house, that Venus got him in trouble. Venus struggles in Aries and even moreso in the 8th. Wayne Williams was allegedly a closeted gay man. Most of the murder victims were young boys. So, also a pedophile. Here is the most perverted manifestation of Venus hiding out, in debility, in a house associated with trauma, death, mystery, and deep deep deep privacy. Was Williams ravaged by his own disowned desires? Venus in a Mars sign can have a violent loving nature, at the very very worst. So this placement sows the seeds of a twisted and knotty psychological pathology around relationships. Why children, though? I'd guess that its all the Mercury emphasis in his chart, specifically the Gemini--the archetype of Peter Pan, forever young and curious. Innocent.

Williams had Mars in Pisces in the 7th (so we see now that he has all the mutable signs activated). This means Venus and Mars have a mutual reception in his chart. Venus helped out Mars from Aries, Mars helped out Venus from Pisces. They strengthened one another. That music was a huge part of his predation is evident here. That he was a predator at all is also evident here. Folks with Mars in the 7th house have relationships that are, well, martial--aggravation, heat, cutting, severing, separation, volatile, violence. In the most basic way, this may just be a person who suffers numerous break ups, or has passionate affairs. But in the most disturbing way, this is a person who relates to others violently.

Williams' Mars was opposite his Moon, and loosely opposite his ascendant. That he could appear shy and bookish only to also descend into deep rage or violence is the opposition at play here. Moon in the first house folks (his in Virgo) are also very talented at getting people to emotionally resonate with them, and in Virgo, its very much the ""wouldn't hurt a fly"" temperament. Many of his friends and family opined that they never saw Williams get angry, or even annoyed. Moon in the 1st house renders one sensitive, emotional, soft and watery. But for Williams, this was a convincing mask. I wouldn't be surprised if his ""safe"" Moon exterior is what led many kids to go off with him. Moon is mothering. And many of his victims were street kids, kind of lacking that warm and safe home environment.

Moon opposite Mars is one of my uh oh's for sussing out someone's capacity for violence or anger.

And Williams has two more of my uh oh's: Saturn square Moon, and Saturn square Mars.

T-square, yall.

Saturn with the Moon is harsh! It dampens emotions, or restricts them completely. To murder anyone, you kind of need to turn off the empathy, and Saturn is that deadening agent. The square also doesn't help, as it becomes a source of unending tension that needs to find an outlet. Emanating from his 4th house, I'd also opine that something happened in his childhood, in relation to his parents, that may have made him snap. It doesn't even have to be long endured abuse of any kind. Maybe an expectation, or a passing comment, that somehow led Williams to overachieve in the worst way, and to hide his sexual desires. His parents were well-respected. But not much else is said about his childhood beyond that.

Saturn square Mars puts both malefics in a malefic conversation with one another. This is an aspect of repressed anger. It can also be an aspect of repressed sexuality, as Mars is the principle of sexual desire in men (his in Pisces--another speculation--could render his sexuality more fluid--and thus we get repressed desires of a gay or bisexual man). Mars Saturn people have a tremendous will to succeed--at anything. These people are formidable. It was often said that Williams could not have killed anyone because of his perceived lack of physical strength. To this I say---don't underestimate the strength of Mars-Saturn people. (To this I also say--if you are a murderer trying to dispose of a body, no doubt you're going to summon up every last piece of strength you have to hide your trail. Much like the phenomenon of a protective mom being able to lift a car if her child is in danger.) Williams also had a disproportionate amount of hate for the demographic of children killed--young, poor, black boys (it matters that they are also darker in complexion, where Williams is very much light/yellow). Without admitting to anything, he said they deserved to die because of their lifestyle, that Atlanta needed to be cleaned up of their type. Yikes. Mars in the other people house explains the hate, Saturn in the sector of home, ancestry, and roots explains why. His Virgo ASC and Moon also likely made him a perfectionist, with ideas of what is perfect, good, how things should be, etc. etc.

This ends the long form narrative style of explanation. Now I just want to list out a few Astrological coincidences:

\-most of the children were strangled in some way, which I think is a manifestation of ASC and Sun ruler Mercury being in Taurus. Taurus rules the neck. Up close and personal killing, using the sense of physical touch

\-when he was arrested, he was SO obsessed with his own celebrity. He held a press conference in his house, was acutely aware of news cameras following him, etc. Sun in the 10th conj. MC and the manifestation of needing fame, recognition

\-his lawyers said he was very difficult to work with, a more textbook manifestation of Mars in the 7th people

\-it is worth noting that his Sun rules his 12th house. In the end, his ego put him in jail (after he was incarcerated, all of the killings stopped)

\-Williams was arrested when transit Mars was conj. his Sun and MC

\-Virgos can be methodical killers, killing with a perceived sense of purpose, a clear directive

\-His Moon had no kind aspects. His emotional life and relationship to his mother were doomed from get go. Plus Moon can behave coldly in Virgo. (hashtag, NotALLVirgos, I know I know)

\-Weirdly enough, it was the Virgo details that sealed his fate. Carpet fibers and dog hairs. Virgo rules small pets.

\-He was a liar. He once passed out a resume saying that he was a pilot and a race-car driver. This is the Virgo overachiever, master of many type of archetype. Also, that lying ass Neptune in the 3rd house. 

\-Williams still proclaims his innocence, and says the real perpetrators were the KKK--and that Atlanta PD and the FBI pinned everything on him to avoid a race war. This has something to do with Saturn down there in his 4th, and his fantasy-making Neptune and Jupiter aspects.

\-Williams was convicted of 2 murders under an interesting set of transits: Sun square his natal Sun and MC, forming a conj. with his natal Mars. Jupiter stationed RX in Scorpio (reversal of good fortune, revealing misdeeds), transit Moon in Aries conj. natal Venus, transit Neptune conj. natal Saturn, and transit Uranus opposite natal Sun. Do with that what you will.

Lastly, Williams had interesting synastry with the city of Atlanta itself. His Sun was opposite the Sag NN of Atlanta. His own personal desires and will were antithetical to the symbolic pursuits of Atlanta. In the documentary, mention is made that these child murders really tarnished the reputation of what Atlanta meant to black folks at the time--as a place to rise up in society (Atlanta has a stellium in Capricorn and was/is a place of black wealth and prestige). It also tarnished the reputation of Atlanta's first black mayor, whose tenure will forever be intermingled with the poor handling of these atrocities. Atlanta's Uranus also conjuncts Williams' Mars. Atlanta was a place where he could be unweildly, where his martial desires were granted excitement, where he behaved erratically and without concern for others. Atlanta's Pluto in Aries was also right on top of Williams' Venus in Aries. In Atlanta, the darker sexual impulses of Williams were awakened and colored with obsession, with power, with control and with disturbance.

1336,"How does our moon sign affect our emotions if science mentions how emotions may be caused by chemicals? Don't get me wrong. I am a believer in astrology and I'm into spirituality, etc.  There are studies mentioning how emotions may be chemically-induced in the brain. I'm at a criss cross of beliefs. For one, your planetary positions affect your energy and make up your energy at birth. I've always thought that emotions were spirit/soul based, so it was easy for me to understand how the moon sign would affect how deeply and how you felt your emotions since it's energy. It's also confusing because I believe when we die, it's only our material body and our spirit (energy) still exists, and spirits feel emotion...so then how would that be possible if they're chemical reactions? I mean of course science isn't always 100% accurate and it's what we think according to brain patterns and correlations, but then again the evidence is there. But then again evidence linking to energy/spirit is there too (I don't mean scientific studies). So I don't know??   😂  Can it be both? What do you think?

I believe in science too, it's just kind of numbing and upsetting to think emotions are really nothing more than chemical reactions, especially if they can be controlled by hormones...almost like they don't really matter in a sense...?",9,0,2020-04-28 01:44:15,astrology

1346,"Echoing patterns through charts in families? I have found a weird kind of echoing pattern through my parents and my chart. My sun is in gemini and so is my Dad's and I understand the sun can signify the relationship with the father. Likewise my moon is in aries and my mother's sun is aries. What's interesting though is my Mum's moon is in capricorn and she always talks about how her mother (my granny) was quite emotionally reserved. My Mum on the other hand is extremely emotional (as she always says) but I think this is down to her moon being in the first house (her emotions are always centered around herself too). Now in my natal chart, my moon has a tight conjunction with saturn by one degree. And I wonder if this has to do with my mother's capricorn moon energies. Having been in therapy and examined my family relationships a lot, one thing that was picked up on was that growing up I wasn't allowed to express my anger. Like my Mum reacted really badly to it, (and my dad was increasingly emotionally distant) which taught me not to express it. And I think it really took something from me (I struggled with mild-severe depression for the majority of my teenage years). My therapist really emphasized that I needed to find my anger. I had therapy before I got into astrology so when I found out about my placements I was like bruh.

Anyway, another thing about my Dad. His moon is in scorpio (sextile pluto 4 degrees), and his mother died when he was just a baby, his dad died a couple of years later. So he experienced a great loss. He doesn't have a lot of friends and doesn't really emotionally connect. (has more so in the past 2 years) I sometimes wonder if I inherited his trauma. My 4th house is ruled by scorpio with a sag pluto in it, and my chiron is in scorpio (3rd house though). My social confidence has been very low much of my life and I have always found it hard to make friends in the sense that it takes me a long time to be comfortable and fully myself around someone (I do have a virgo rising, which I think contributes to this).  At one point in my life I did lose my dad, he left our family and I chose not to speak to him for a year. Our relationship is healing now though. 

Unfortunately I don't have my grandparent's charts, which would be really useful in developing this theory further. I wonder if anyone else has found the same thing?

1355,"11th house Does anyone else here have an 11th house stellium? How does it impact you? I find this is one of the most complicated houses, as everyones first association with it tends to be friendship, then ambitions and dreams and one's overall relationship with society. But I've noticed my upcoming solar return charts have been hounded with the 11th house badly aspected and in planets such as pluto, which can be used to predict death in the family, and even moreso than the 8th house.

My 11th house cusp is gemini and it contains venus, mars, and saturn. mars and saturn are in cancer and mars is at 0 degrees. This has taken me a really long time to understand because I've always thought of myself as really independent and somewhat of a loner, which didnt make sense until I did more research on saturn. My saturn in 11th manifests heavily for me and seems to overpower venus and mars. I dont have close friendships but I find actually I think about my friends and the people who I talk to like constantly and they impact my subconscious a lot. I've always had trouble making friends, though, and have had a lifelong aversion to any kind of group mentality. when I was younger especially and more immature I just hated anything that was popular and always was on the outside looking in. I've grown out of this a little because I became less judgmental of others while also more confident in my originality. People with a lot of 11th house influence, are you into politics and are your ideas considered new and different? I'm not exactly passionate about politics but I can be at times. I dont see myself as a leader or an activist though. Some may think my views are extreme but I'm more or less indifferent and I keep my philosophies basic, like let people do whatever they want as long as doesnt harm others. I am an anarchist and would prefer less organization over more. My ideal society would have  little to no influence from the government. I am opposed to both capitalism and communism.  I do have my strong opinions but like I feel like these arent actually as important in my life as you'd think? Im more concerned about myself than the world and I definitely live in my head. Maybe politics will gain more emphasis as I grow older becuz I'm 15 and the 11th is ruled by saturn (time).  Back to the topic of friendships, I do tend to make friends who are older than me and who definitely expect too much of me and kind of drop me for good if I fail to meet their expectations, you know what I mean? Like its always been rough and I've felt like I cant rely on anyone, its everyone for themself. I can see how Mars make sense for that too. And I am REALLY competitive. The friends I do have are definitely extremely artistic though (venus). And as saturn's position would suggest I'm really close with my grandparents .

And I still have yet to cover the house in its entirety. I am extremely ambitious. My whole life revolves around my future, it seems. I have big plans and I think I have a remarkable ability to manifest them which I'm still learning to improve. I'm very much ""dont dream it, be it."" I've seen people say the 11th house is also associated with intelligence and even genius. I wont boast or anything but I think this is a possibility for others . Lastly it also relates to social media. I do tend to go on social media much more than I'd be comfortable with. Since saturn in 11th has given me a life of feeling isolated and untrustworthy of others I dont really share much of myself but I lurk on it a lot and when I do crave attention and validation the desire for it can like consume me. I am overcoming this because I want to be even more independent. I actually would like to get rid of my phone for a long time.

ANYWAY. sorry for wall of text. I really want to hear other things about the 11th house and your own experiences with it, especially in positions such as pluto or chiron. Houses and signs shouldnt be put together but for reference my only aquarius placement is 6th house neptune. also my 7th house cusp is aquarius. (I also have uranus in 7th, so I definitely can tell my significant other is gonna be weird af)

Fixed Earth- a beautiful, deeply rooted oak- solid, immovable and fully at peace (Venus). Gaia herself.

Mutable Air- the playful, agile, ever-changing wind- the ultimate trickster.

Cardinal Water- the waves, the tides, the ocean currents and rain (water with momentum/ generates life)- all controlled by the Moon.

Fixed Fire- the Sun itself, an inexhaustible source of warmth and light. Radiant. Majestic. Everything revolves around it.

Mutable Earth- grains/cereals/herbs- earth that can be harvested and categorised and put to use. Plants that can be distilled and used medicinally.

Cardinal Air- the clouds- actively regulate and harmonise the climate. A beautiful, aesthetic and artistic form of air (Venus).

Fixed Water- frozen water- ice- so cold it burns. Or alternatively the highly pressurised depths of the ocean.

Mutable Fire- the distant fire of the stars which inspire and are used to navigate. Alternatively an untameable wildfire that runs free.

Cardinal Earth- the mountains and glaciers- stony, cold and barren, but powerful. Steadily build upwards.

Fixed Air- the upper atmosphere- freezing, pressurised air- high vantage point over all the earth. Remote.

1367,"Astrologically-linked bloodlines, Signs/aspects carrying through generations? I was wondering if anyone else had found examples of signs or aspects carrying on through generations. I've been studying natal charts of dozens of my family members, and there seems to be a strong correlation on my father's side of the family to the signs of Cancer and Capricorn (with some examples of strong Sagittarius/Gemini aspects in the 3rd decan as well). Everyone so far has had a planet in one or both of the two signs, with many Cancer Suns, Ascendants and Moons. I myself have a 7+ planet Capricorn stellium including North Node with my Ascendant at Sagittarius 29. I've found similar string of traits in other families I've studied as well.

1377,"Trying to understand the elements better So astrology is becoming quite amazing to me and the more I study it the more I am amazed about how accurate it is to me. However, the elements are still kind of confusing to me. Actually really confusing. 

Like I get that Earth signs are capricorn, taurus, and virgo. And I can see it inside peoples faces without even needing to get to know them. I think it's because earth signs have very distinct bones structures so it's easier to tell from appearence alone what sign they are. However, my question is what makes people of a certain element and how can I visualize how this element looks. What I mean is before I thought that elements in astrology were just metaphors to describe personality. But the more I study astrology and after reading astrology, psychology and the 4 elements I am realizing that the elements are not just metaphors but are in fact a direct manifestation in a persons personality and physical body. We are all made from the same material as anything else on this earth or universe. Just variations of 4 elements. 

So here are my questions:

Why are earth signs seperated throughout the year. Like there are 4 seasons so why are each element scattered thoughout the seasons why not just have 1 element all in 1 season?

Also how can I visualise each sign in a materialist way? If that is even possible. I'm a virgo, so i need to really be able to visualize to understand how these elements act within a person. This may be too abstract a question but what exactly is

cardinal fire ? Not sure how any element can be cardinal?

fixed earth ? This makes sense sort of

mutable air ?

cardinal water ?

fixed fire ?

mutable earth ? earth is solid so it seems kind of weird that earth is acting like water.

Cardinal air ?

fixed water ?

mutable fire ?

cardinal earth ? New earth? Earth that is moving? Moving forward ? Growing ? Like a tree?

fixed air ? This is confusing to me because air is always moving so how can it be fixed?

mutable water ? isnt water always mutable ?

&amp;#x200B;

Im not really sure what i'm asking. Like all of this is  organized so well and makes some intuitive sense and is very poetic. However there is something here that I am just not grasping of how to really understand and visualize these things. It's like in music . Like I feel and understand music on an intuitive level. But when i study music theory it just seems like magic. Like how a half step can completely change the mood of a chord from positive to negative.  Sorry for not really being clear. I'm not exactly sure what i'm asking myself.",7,8,2020-04-24 20:08:36,astrology
1378,"Transits for spiritual work, healing and herbs When it comes to certain (non recreational) spiritual practices such as holotropic breathing or psychedelic therapy we know that set and setting are of crucial importance.

It is already hard work in and of itself to confront these traumas (plutonian shadow work) so it´s only normal to look for an appropriate environment too. A journey with potent plant medicines can either result in a life-changing and delicate healing experience or a disatrous ""spiritual emergency"" event. It´s a form of subtle surgery if you like. It should be noted that not everyone´s psyche is adapted for some of these depth-psychology tools. For instance extremely clairvoyant people (Neptunian?) and people prone to schizophrenia, with sensitive connections to what is called their ""higher-mind"" alongside a porous ego, may lack the required grounding for these methods so they should use more progressive tools instead.

The famous depth psychologist who created the field of transpersonal psychology once said :

“I have come to regard astrology, particularly transit astrology, as the long-sought “Rosetta stone” of consciousness research, providing an essential key for understanding the nature and content of holotropic or non-ordinary states of consciousness, both spontaneous and induced.”  
\~ Stanislav grof

So on this subject I have two questions and I would love to see your feedback on this.

1)In general what are the favorable astrological transits for psychedelic therapy?

\- While a physical surgery would not recommend a Full Moon, perhaps here this would be interesting : to release more repressed emotions.  
\- Can the Moon be in the sign of the Heart (Leo), or the Head (Aries) ? Or perhaps avoiding the body parts being (metaphysically) operated on?  
\- Probably look for harmonious aspects with the Sun and the Moon and the planet ruling the sign of the 8th house (occult, surgery).  
\- Positive influences of Jupiter and Venus in the 6th house (health)

\- Perhaps avoiding retrograde Mercury, Venus, Mars if possible.  
\- Avoiding aspects with Lilith, Chiron, south node? (I´m not sure)  
\- Avoiding negative aspects with Saturn  
\- Avoiding Saturn-Pluto synods (according to thousands of observations by Grof)  
\- While Jupiter-Uranus synods have shown positive creative breakthroughs (Grof again)  
\- What house and sign is Pluto in? And what about mahadashas?

\- Perhaps avoiding retrograde Mercury, Venus, Mars if possible.- Avoiding aspects with Lilith, Chiron, south node? (I´m not sure)- Avoiding negative aspects with Saturn- Avoiding Saturn-Pluto synods (according to thousands of observations by Grof)- While Jupiter-Uranus synods have shown positive creative breakthroughs (Grof again)- What house and sign is Pluto in? And what about mahadashas?

This could also depend on what kind of plant medicine we are using. Western alchemy and spagyrics has tried to establish planetary correspondances with most herbs. Indeed all plants crystalize in seven basic crystal structures. If I have to guess I would say that some entheogens are very plutonian like Iboga (""the dark jewel""), some very solar/yang (San Pedro) and others are more lunar/watery/feminine/yin like Ayahuasca. The archetypes that appear during the trip can hint at this : Ayahuasca often takes the form of a female women (Diana or Venus) or a snake. Tradionally Cannabis is a herb of Saturn (Agrippa, Paracelsus), although the Salvia family being tied to Saturn makes more sense to me.

2) According to my chart and its transits should I engage in psychedelic therapy this summer (August) or delay it to later ?

I´ve been considering getting into some delicate shadow work related to a powerful medicine (plutonian or solar) which triggers temporary egodeath.

Suprisingly, Pluto has been transiting in my 8th house for the last 7 years and this transit/chapter has 3 more years to go before it moves into house 9. This made me realize why I have been getting quite deep into the occult during all this time all culminating to this recent climax. I am also in the middle of a 17-year long Saturn mahadasha which has been been hard work.

Initially I was considering doing a session in the beginning of August. But 2020 has brought up an collective extreme transit with Pluto-Saturn-Jupiter in Capricorn...which happens to be in my 8th house!!! It seems that life is telling me to go for healing and occult work during these next 3 years (Pluto in house 8), however perhaps I should wait for next year when Saturn in Aquarius moves away from Jupiter and Pluto? I also have my first Saturn return coming in a year.

I have a Capricon Stellium in the 9th (Neptune, Uranus, N.Node) and 10th (Venus, Mars) houses, and I recently looked more into what exactly that meant. I learned that I was born during the period in the late 80s/early 90s when many outer planets were passing through Capricorn.

This atricle talks about how the kids born under this star are now coming into their Saturn Returns as they get into their 30s, and the significance of this for society's future as a whole: [https://www.astrodynamics.net/the-seeds-of-the-capricorn-stellium-blooming-now/](https://www.astrodynamics.net/the-seeds-of-the-capricorn-stellium-blooming-now/)

So, for those born under this Star (between 1988-1993), what major lessons do you feel are coming around on your return? Maybe we all have some common themes, I would bet that we do.

I am just entering my Saturn Return phase (born in 92, turned 28 in Feb.) and I'm finding that my interest in Astrology, Occult, and Spiritualism has been revitalized after years of being put on a shelf for more ""productive"" pursuits. I've spent years seeking approval from authority figures I respect, longing to hear a respectable professional say, ""You really have talent, let me mentor you in my field"". But now, after experiencing different lifestyles, and observing first-hand how the ""professionals"" don't even have all the answers themselves, I'm realizing that there's no reason why I can't make my own future. I don't need some all-knowing guide to show me the ""acceptable"" route to achievement, I'm perfectly capable of carving out my own path based on whatever the fuck I want to do. And if I want to figure out how to combine writing, psychotherapy, and the esoteric studies into my own career path, then I don't need pre-recorded ""how-to-steps"" to make that happen.

So I think that's one of my major lessons for this return -- to let go of the need to feel recognized by perceived superiors and realize that I can make myself into one of those figures I always looked up to all on my own, without anybody's tutelage.",3,5,2020-04-24 08:15:26,astrology

1411,"A New Beginner Astrology Sub! Hi! I just started a new astrology sub specifically for beginners, r/beginnerastrology. I've noticed a lot of people are really confused by their natal charts and some who don't even realize there's more than the big three, or even more than the sun signs!

It's tough to be a beginner! There's SO much to learn and so many different directions to go. Its often hard to judge what is consistent, good information. 

The goal of this sub is to help people who are brand new or still beginners in astrology get the guidance they need to build a strong foundation. It's not for chart readings. It's meant to be a place where beginners can feel comfortable asking questions about astrology and getting involved in the community! 

Everyone is welcome! So if it sounds like something you're interested in, whether learning or helping, check it out 😊 r/beginnerastrology! Thank you mods for letting me make this post! 💐",1,26,2020-04-23 07:18:40,astrology

But there is a transit coming this summer that I see being very, very important.


Gemini sun will square a mars-Neptune in Pisces conjunction. This has media and information written all over it. Cover ups? Neptune does represent deceit and Mars is intent. Or, maybe they will try to scare ppl even more which sounds just as likely. Either way, some info is going to come out and it is going to be huge. The sun is about illuminating or putting the focus on something. I think a cover up comes about and they fail and do it publicly . Or they will try and scare ppl with false statistics and false information.

1417,"What are the best big 3 combos you’ve seen? (Sun/Rising/Moon) I think one of the best combos I’ve seen is one of my best friend’s big 3:

Aries Sun/Taurus Rising/Sag Moon (btw this is not me, I’m an Aries/Aries/Cap).

I was always so impressed with how versatile my friend is and I don’t get impressed often (Aries/Aries/Cap).

She is one of the smartest people I know, have an amazing sense of humor, works for a NYC power house law firm, loves traveling and having fun and is really refined/appreciates the arts and fashion. She legit loves going to museums.

She finally did her chart today and it made so much sense.

The adventurous, smart, resilient, go getter side - if I can make it here I can make it anywhere (law form in NYC) - Aries Sun

The persistency and career stability, the love for refined wines, food, fashion and museums - Taurus Rising

The fun loving, global trotter, let’s drink until 6am and I’ll still be ready for work the next morning: Sag Moon

It’s a pretty ideal combination. I think her one problem is being a little overly romantic and only wanting to settle for a big love and acting a bit childish in relationships at times considering how together her life is. I guess I should check her Venus?",33,7,2020-04-23 08:38:00,astrology

1422,"The Cancer Archetype- Feminine Authority and a Mother's Wisdom Cancer is a sign that has suffered more from the historical subjugation of women than any other sign. It's a feminine sign- strike one. It's an emotive water sign- strike two. It's ruled by the Moon, the planet of women and motherhood- strike three. The same stereotypes that were designed to break down women and put them in their place are the same stereotypes pushed onto Cancer in astrology circles today- weak, histrionic, irrational, unstable, not in control of their emotions. It seems Cancer has been pegged as the weepy nurturer with not much else to offer, a weakening influence on a chart. That mindset speaks more to societies view on femininity than it does to the sign of Cancer. It seems to me Cancer is in need of a re-framing. 

The cardinal signs offer different brands of leadership. The forceful military command of Aries. The fair and democratic leadership of Libra. The firm and responsible hand of patriarchal Capricorn. And finally Cancer- the matriarch, the feminine authority (for whatever reason I'm picturing a circle of women on a beach beneath the Moon, tapping into their feminine power). Supportive leadership, emotionally driven leadership. Leadership that sustains and nurtures those that it directs and governs. Leadership that connects and instills a deep sense of belonging. This is the nature of Cancer and its ruler the Moon, the Queen of the heavens, beloved of her subjects. Cancer is the life-giving properties of water- water that is nourishing, enriching, life-affirming- water that rushes forth to envelop and cause everything that it touches to flourish. It is where mother ocean surges forth to meet land creating one of the most dynamic landscapes on earth, a place where life thrives. It is the creative nexus of the womb and the birth of a child into the world at the breaking of the waters- a vulnerable but powerful moment when emotions are heightened and hearts are open. This is not weakness, this is strength. To walk through the world open and receptive is potent and remarkable. To take something so vulnerable and nurture it to full strength is a feat. 

And this is why Jupiter is exalted in Cancer. There is nothing Jupiter cannot accomplish in the life-giving summer solstice sign of Cancer, where creative life force is in absolute *abundance*. It's also fair to say that for the majority of people the person that guides them, advises them, offers wisdom and support is their mother. Good mothers are the counsellors, gurus and guardians of all that they support. This is a vital and inherent (yet overlooked) quality of Cancer energy. And so Jupiter *loves* it, because here he has the broadest reach- you may not open up to a priest- but you will open up to your mother. And so we see the protective, guiding hand of the matriarch. Guardianship. Feminine wisdom and intuition. Emotional attunement and responsiveness. Cancer is the waves and the tides of the ocean, ebbing and flowing, pushing and pulling; ever fluctuating like the waxing and waning of the Moon. But the waves and tides are not always gentle, they can turn forceful as the mother who defends her child, as the matriarch who defends her community, as the Moon goddesses of old who were both tender and nurturing but fierce. And so Cancer shields those who need them. They take something small and vulnerable and nurture it to the point it can be delivered into the world. This could be a person, it could be an idea, a business, a creative project- all nurtured and grown, infused with genuine emotion and birthed into the world. The creative potential of Cancer is only rivalled by the other luminary sign, Leo. Together they light the world. 

If you made it this far thanks for reading. I hope you see how the lack of respect Cancer receives in modern astrology is unjust and is a legacy of the subjugation of the feminine. I hope this also brought some validation to people with Cancer placements who feel overlooked or poorly represented. We are not told that we are powerful, we are not told we are charismatic, we are not told that we are intelligent, we are not told that we have much to offer beyond being of service to others. So it's often a long road to learning to love our Cancer placements. I'm there now, I see how special and powerful it is, and hopefully this has helped you to do the same.",125,461,2020-04-22 09:00:53,astrology
1423,"Today and the USA Last night, I remembered Austin Coppock and Chris Brennan on The Astrology Podcast speculate on events that may take place around this time. Timecoded video [here](https://youtu.be/WL399uI8cgk?t=2h), and the quote:

*Recorded March 26th, 2020; speaking on the New Moon conjunct Uranus on April 22nd, 2020...*
&gt;Chris: New Moon. New Moon hits Uranus... a thrust for liberation, but then in seeking freedom— an urge for freedom —the moon squares Mars, and you get the Mars significations...

&gt;Austin: This is just speculation, but... maybe there are some places where people go into protest mode against quarantines... there’s chaos... Mars stirs action. On an emotional level Mars stirs anger, so we may have something like that towards the end of [April 2020].

Well, here we are. It’s April 22nd, 2020, and in the United States there are protests occurring to end these lockdowns. Some states are beginning to halt protests with public safety as the reason-cited, but this will surely just add fuel to the fire, escalating already-boiling tensions.

The above speculations-turned-reality, coupled with the fact that these protests seem to be originating in the US made me wonder: why here? Why is the country going through this?

#Current Transits to the United States

If we take a look at the US Natal Chart and check transits for the New Moon on April 22nd, we see some interesting configurations occurring...

*Transits &lt;&gt; US Natal Chart*

- Uranus square North/South Node [00°A11’]
- Mercury conjunct Chiron [00°S32’]
- Pluto opposite Mercury [00°S47]
- Chiron square Jupiter [01°S03’]
- New Moon square North/South Node [03°A19’]
- Pluto square Chiron [04°S51’]
- Saturn conjunct South Node [04°A58’]
- New Moon square Pluto [05°A43’], conjunct Jupiter
- Chiron opposite Saturn [07°A48’]

Reading a few interpretations for the above on Astro Gold, we can see the phrases...
&gt;...an unexpected crisis may arise stretching your communication skills to the limit. [Pluto opposite Mercury]

&gt;You may even suffer from a disease. [Saturn conjunct South Node]

&gt;Fate is forcing a change in direction. [Uranus square NN]

&gt;Avoiding painful thoughts or news is unwise. It is time to face the truth and forgive and forget. [Mercury conjunct Chiron]

&gt;Now is a time when you are saying ""goodbye"" to one phase of your life and entering a new one. You come face to face with the past and have to make some difficult decisions. Life becomes filled with situations that can no longer be avoided. [Saturn conjunct South Node]

&gt;This is quite a challenge as you firstly have to face the obstacles from the past, even if it means facing the fact that you are often your own worst enemy. [Chiron square Jupiter]

&gt;Deep healing and deep pain are both possible... Either way you are required to delve within for answers and to try new methods of handling your problems. [Pluto square Chiron]

&gt;It is up to you to listen, learn and move forward. [Sun square NN]

It is fairly clear the United States is going through a major moment in its life.

The events that take place now and into the near future will shape the nation into something entirely different in the coming years. 

Initially— as we are currently seeing the beginning of this trend —this will be an incredibly painful time for the nation and its people, as the ways of the past will not get the the country out of the hole it is in; new ideas must be implemented.

#Positive Action
However, I do despise the doomsday talk. The power of astrology is that we can look ahead, see that there is a tomorrow, and react proactively to current events.

It doesn’t seem that positive action will take place in the short-term due to the current astrological trends; but,

If we are to believe that astrology is the be-all-end-all, the nation’s leadership could look to the stars and see how one could take the current situation as an opportunity to reinvent itself...

*April 22nd; Transits &lt;&gt; US Natal Chart*
&gt;Opportunities come but once in a lifetime... Now is the time for you to be open to opportunities. [Chiron trine North Node 00°S23’]

&gt;Now is the time to take a chance and explore new and unusual experiences, to tackle life's problems in an inventive and original way... particularly those involving metaphysics, science and computers. [Chiron sextile Uranus 01°A55’]

&gt;You may not be in a practical mode but you are open to ideas, new ways of viewing projects and a more creative approach. [Neptune trine Mercury 04°A12’]

&gt;This is a time of rejuvenation and regeneration, when you have the opportunity to release troubling aspects of your life and walk a new path. [Chiron trine Ascendant 05°A21’]

&gt;Right now you are able to evaluate your direction in life and make adjustments to help you stay purposeful. You may not realise it but you are changing in ways that will enable you to achieve your ambitions, particularly in the area of career. [Pluto trine MC 06°A03’]

Many of the above, beneficial aspects will be playing out over the next months and years. Positive change is coming, and although initially-painful, what is happening now will propel the nation forward in incredible ways. It will only take time.

#The Nation and Pluto Transits

Couple the above by also looking at past US Pluto transits (as the nation is going through its Pluto Return) and we can see a pattern arise [[source](https://500yearparty.wordpress.com/tag/pluto-return/)]...

- Opening Square: Mexican-American War. This lead to a massive expansion west, across the current United States. Would new states be free or slave states? This being brought to the forefront of people’s minds lead to the Civil War many years later, and sowed the seeds for universal freedoms across races, genders, and peoples; these would come up over the following decades.
- Opposition: 1937, The New Deal. Socialist ideologies became front and center, and, along with WWII, helped the US get out of the Great Depression. 
- Closing Square: Reagan. Free-market capitalism, reduction in government spending, and deregulation.

Now we are at the Pluto Return. The country will be forever changed by inheriting lessons of the past three major configurations, yet I believe the 1937 opposition primarily points to where the country is moving towards.

#The Age of Aquarius

First, I do not believe we will see any majorly-positive changes for the nation until the Jupiter/Saturn conjunction in Aquarius, December 2020. Before then...

The nation will enter another great depression. Corporations will be shuttered, or move out, and unemployment will be widespread. Democrats could take over the House, Senate, and Presidency in 2020 resulting in a massively swayed political spectrum; the moderate-Democrat Biden and Republican-dominate Supreme Court will help the Aquarian changes occurring at the federal level from being overly-drastic.

The nation will take years to recover from current events; a broken United States may cause other nations to try to posture themselves, and take advantage of the weakened super power through diplomacy or war. The world’s nations will be preoccupied with this while the US— just like in the 40s —was left alone as to not “wake the beast”. During this time the nation will heal, grow, supercharge and ready itself for the Age or Aquarius faster than any other nation will be able.

What will this look like? Possibly: a swift, nation-wide move to clean energy. Debt relief. Healthcare and income reform. The widespread adoption of remote work. A shift to suburbia living. New modes of low-cost and speedy mass transit. City ‘greenification’. A strong focus on arts and creativity. A new internet. An explosion of international travel and tourism. Globalization. A stronger United Nations. An ultimate pause in conflicts... and likely much more that we can’t even begin to fathom.

Why will this happen? Because a great fall always precedes an incredible rise. America, specifically, is not as fragile as we think it is. 

#Conclusions

If I may say one last thing: in the coming months, when the headlines get loud and foundational cracks become fissures, take a deep breath and try not to worry. Remember that there is a tomorrow, and tomorrow will always come.

The United States will become a beacon of hope and freedom again; I can only hope that it won’t be the only country to do so. No matter where you are in the world, use today to plan for the future. Be the change you want to see. Work towards a better tomorrow; a tomorrow built on the foundation of peace and collective growth.

COVID-19 and Uranus in Taurus I just realized another manifestation of Uranus in Taurus is the radically different ways the food supply chain and food experience has been damaged due to COVID during this crisis. But more importantly: we will never eat or dine out the same way again. 

The food industry I’m speaking to includes everything from stronger unionization among workers to mom and pop restaurants/groceries falling under with only the chains thriving to the fact that we are never going to eat at a restaurant without large spaces between tables and/or masks. What are legit chefs going to do? They can’t prepare food with gloves. 

The Guardian ran a piece proclaiming that only the most “adaptable” restaurants will survive.

These are all fundamental Uranian archetypes. The lightening bolt of change, the revolution around how we value people, where money goes, and the realization that the future will look nothing like the past. 

Also: the beauty industry (Taurus) is taking a large hit. Nail salons, hair salons, massage and wellness places, make up artists—the future is so uncertain. Hell even tenants refusing to pay rent fits this general trend of material and financial disruption. Square from Saturn ain’t helpful

1452,"The 12th house, ASC/DSC line and MC/IC line. Why is the 12th house is typically referred to as the house of what’s “hidden”? 

The reason I ask this is because in a typical birth chart reading, there are four “directions” that give a sort of “reference system” which the central point of the chart measures with respect to. We can simplify this to two axes because they are in pairs. I’m talking about the ASC/DSC line and MC/IC line. The ASC direction is the the direction of the eastern horizon. The DSC is your western horizon. MC is midheaven or “top of the sky” and IC is Imum Coeli or “bottom of the sky.” 

With all that being said, why is the 12th house what is hidden as it lies just above the horizon where the sun rises? Couldn’t one say that things located around the IC such as 3rd and 4th house are truly “hidden” as from the perspective of the center, the bottom of the sky is never in view? I do understand the signs play a role in what each house means. I guess maybe I don’t know what the deal is with the MC/IC line. I’ve heard that the ascendant is your “first experience” upon brith and the descendant is what you need more of. 

I am confusion. Could anyone describe the properties of these important points and lines as well as answer why the 12th house is “that what’s hidden” even if it is in view from the perspective of the chart owner?",9,5,2020-04-22 04:21:29,astrology

I find that I come across a lot of Taureans (probably cause I’m a Taurus descendant) and almost all of them I meet I find them to be nothing short of amazing. I believe that Taurus is the kindest and loyalest sign out of the zodiac, and they’re very caring as well. Taurus offers a stable support system that you can certainly rely on, they always offer a hand to those they care about. They’re great at advice, and can help you see the beauty in life’s most difficult situations. They will always be there to encourage you to keep pushing forward even when your life seems to be getting off track, and they do this in a very gentle, caring and nurturing way. If you’re lucky enough to be friends with them you’ll know that they offer a ride or die type friendship, and they will always be thoughtful of you. You will also be aware that the stereotype of them being boring is far from true, they will surely have you entertained even in the most mundane situations. They are as loyal as they come and will not only fend for you in your presence but in your absence as well. They offer genuineness, stability, loyalty and beauty to your life and I very much appreciate all the Taureans I’ve had the pleasure to befriend.",284,339,2020-04-21 02:36:58,astrology

This has been happening with me ever since I discovered I will be experiencing Pluto square my moon for the next nearly three years. Everything I’ve read about it points to immeasurable suffering and doom. It makes me really frustrated because I’ve always used astrology as a positive tool, and now it is filling me with complete hopelessness. 

But a persons chart and transits aren’t just about one aspect are they? Can’t good things happen during a negative transit? Aren’t there always other transits going on that point to happy times as well as bad? I can’t imagine 3 years of non stop pain. Pluto is also trining my Venus so perhaps that will transmute some of the negativity. Its just rather maddening reading all these cookbook definitions of what a Pluto to moon transit means, when in reality there are very few firsthand accounts of peoples own personal experiences through it due to Pluto being such a slow moving body.

I’m wondering if anyone else has shared a similar experience, allowing predictive astrology to cause fear and pain rather than being a tool for growth and guidance.

You're free to disagree on this, let me know what you think.

Now, as a lazy Cancer Sun with an enthusiastic but not very consistent Aries Moon, I feel that if it weren't for my diligent Virgo rising I wouldn't get anything done. However, when my Moon is into it (i.e. when I feel motivated), I really see a difference. 

I know that, stereotipically speaking, Aries Moons love to start new things, Taurus Moons love to see things through etc., but it would be great to find a way to motivate myself starting from what I know about my placements.

For instance, why I try to do at the moment is to throw some variety in the things I have to do (be it working out or studying) and to break them into small sections - the Pomodoro Technique seems to work great with me - so that I'm not facing endless boring chores and I'm actually more motivated.

Then there is the 1 3 5 sun sign trine pattern where each sign of a certain element looks up to the next one in a mentor/mentee dynamic, but it's expressed with subtle differences owing to the qualities of each modality. So Cardinal energy being perhaps the youngest of all three, Aries would look up to Leo, the way a younger brother looks up to an older one. And between the mutables and cardinals there is a fun bantering mischief type of best friends in crime dynamic that is not shared with the fixed signs.

For those that don't know the mythology Juno is the wife of Jupiter (you can replace this for any pantheon, I prefer to use the Roman nomenclature for common astrological reference). Despite being queen of all Gods, she was not satisfied with Jupiter relationship with her. She wanted more from the benelovent God and found herself always wanting even when she had it all. .Juno spends approximately 3-4 years in each sign.

[Written By Marie Rousseau]

Juno in:

Aries: You tend to find that the other person is never as motivated as you'd like them to be. They just don't seem to have as much action or will to do things, no matter how much they accomplish or how quickly they do it, it just isn't fast enough.

Taurus: Why can't your partner just reach the moral levels of a God?! You find they either never have enough money for your liking (so what this person is a billionaire...they can be a trillionaire if only they'd save EVERY penny.) And their values always seem to be lacking.

Gemini: Your partner just never knows enough. They never communicate enough. You want to know all the information and even if you had their entire biography in a book, the fact that their future endeavors aren't written as well is unsatisfactory. 

Cancer: You just need someone who understands how to nurture you...every waking minute. Your partners never seem emotional enough for you. They should be just as moved by things as you are and you can't seem to get what you feel you need. Even if they held your hand on your death bed, your ghost would be pissed off they didn't weep uncontrollably into your dead chest.

Leo: They could lay a red carpet out for you. Turn their IG page into nothing but pictures for you and the endless love they have, they could play every board game with you in existence, and it's still not enough attention. Your partners always seem too serious and not as playful as you as well. 

Virgo: If Mr (Mrs) clean was an actual person, they still wouldn't satisfy the level of hygiene you expect from your partner. You also always seem to get the person who misses the details. Why can't they ever be on the same analytical level as you?

Libra: If your partner shared their soul with you, the fact that they didn't share their ipad with you as well is a cause of distress. You just want things to be fair and they never seem to be quite as fair as you'd like. They also lack the tactfulness you expect in a partner and even if they presented themselves well, the two different colored socks (that only you can see)  is embarrassing.

Scorpio: You tend to find your partners are not as deep and probing as you are and they're not as suspicious as you either. It is so hard to get them to be less trusting of others as you seem to find them always inviting people in. And there's never ever enough sex.

Sagittarius: Put the funniest comedian and the greatest philosopher on Earth together and they still wouldn't live up to the expectations you have.  You love to travel and they never seem to want to go to enough places,  even if they traveled the world.  Any instance of them behaving closely to what's familiar to you, disappointment sets in.

Capricorn: Why do your partners find everything so damn funny? Why aren't they as orderly as you? Why are they so weak? Questions you ask yourself constantly.  You just want them to take life seriously and if they don't boss up to your liking, you feel let down. 

Aquarius: Your partner needs to leave your technology alone,  they need to get more technical and fix everything.  If they can't troubleshoot their own phones,  you start to wonder why you even bothered.  And no matter how intelligent they are,  they never seem smarter than you. 

Pisces: Is there a reason your partner needs to be in your space and know everything? You surely wish they didn't.  Your partners always seem to loud,  even while they're sleeping.  They think too much when they could be dreaming instead and you'll never understand why the mundane world means more to them than a good ol fashion meditation.  Even a monk couldn't satisfy your need for peace.",6,6,2020-04-20 11:05:19,astrology

1497,"Astrology of shows: CW’s The Flash? (Rant) I used to love this show’s earlier seasons, but as it progressed, I have found it incredibly hard to watch. The main thing I can’t stand is the characters being so overly emotional and having to talk everything out in almost every scene! And when I looked up the actors’ natal charts, I found that most of them are Air/Earth dominant! Shouldn’t this show be a lot more lighthearted and action-oriented than it is? 

For example, every time a character gets upset (which is often), they run off, and another character has to go console them. While they’re doing that, one of them starts to cry/tears up, then the other one cries, and then they grow stronger together because they just poured out all their feelings in a matter of minutes before they’re called into action. Right.

Here are the actors’ major placements:

Barry Allen/The Flash: Capricorn sun, Virgo moon, Cap mercury, Aquarius venus, Sag Mars.

Iris West-Allen: Cancer sun, Libra moon, Gemini mercury, Gemini venus, Pisces mars.

Cisco/Vibe: Taurus sun, Libra moon, Taurus mercury, Taurus venus, Gemini mars.

HR/Dr.Wells: Scorpio sun, Aquarius moon, Libra mercury, Scorpio venus, Sagittarius mars (and weirdly, the LEAST emotional of all) 

Caitlin/Killer Frost: Virgo sun, Leo moon, Libra mercury, Libra venus, Virgo mars. 

Ralph Dibny: Aquarius sun, Pisces moon, Capricorn mercury, Pisces venus, Pisces mars (also not that much of an emotional character). 

Nora West-Allen/XS: Libra sun, Aquarius moon, Libra mercury, Scorpio venus, Sag mars. 

I could keep going but I think you get the point. I’m trying to understand why, if the entire cast has Air placements in their birth charts, they put so much emphasis on feelings and emotions in EVERY. SINGLE. EPISODE. My theory is that the show is trying to overcompensate for their natural detachment towards deeper feelings, so they throw their characters into the melodrama.

1508,"North Node in Aries These are some notes I took on my NN in Aries from the chapter in Jan Spiller's 'Astrology of the Soul.' I recently posted notes about Pluto in the 12th house and it seemed like people found lots of value in it, so I thought I'd share these as well.  I recommend Jan Spiller's book for anyone interested in deepening their understanding of evolutionary / past life astrology.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Aries NN people blend their energies with others to avoid standing out as an individual.** They are so sensitive, they fear that being acknowledged could be overwhelming.
   * They are accustomed to melding their energy with those in their immediate environment. To support others effectively, they are tremendously aware. In past lives, their tools were love, reassurance, gentle words of encouragement, and confidence that the other person would emerge victorious in any situation. Their focus was always on the other person. They were part of a team, and if their partner did well**, this ensured their own survival.**
   * Although this worked well in past lives, in this incarnation another person's happiness is not enough to evoke true happiness for Aries NN folks. They don't have enough personal identity left in their battery to hold the charge from the other person. **They must focus on developing their own identity and recharging their own battery**.
   * They merge with the other person's energy field in a very codependent way. They plug into the other person's energy and **add whatever ingredient is needed to keep things harmonious**.
      * They have the ability to see not only the rough edges in people but their loving qualities as well. They perceive who others really are and they celebrate the truth. In that state they feel high - they are fully celebrating the glory, strength, energy, light, and life in the other person. It makes them feel incredibly loving. **Their challenge is to see the same beauty in themselves.**
   * They relate to the relationship. The other person rests at their personal center. They **must de-emphasize the idea that relationships are necessary for their survival.**
      * ""If only I can find the perfect partner, I'll feel complete in myself."" This feeling of completeness they seek can only be achieved individually.
      * They have lived a lot of 'householder' lifetimes; They love to give, its in their nature. But their motive needs to be love, not codependency. If they feel resentful, they need to pull back to recharge.
      * It is crucial for them to have their own space, surrounded by their own possessions, to reinforce their sense of identity.
* They can appreciate the beauty in all their choices, which makes them indecisive. **They are accustomed to appreciating the beauty of everything outside themselves**. They aren't in touch with having 'favorites' of anything because they don't know what their own tastes and preferences are, they have a tough time picking one thing and saying 'THIS IS IT.'
   * In this lifetime, they are developing single-mindedness. Rather than weighing everything before making a choice, they are learning the value of following their initial impulse. Rather than the referee, these natives are supposed to learn to be the point of view.
   * When they feel an impulse, they need to follow through with it. Owing to self-purification in past lives, they can trust that their impulses are not harmful to others. When they notice 'selfishness' in others, they should use it as a reminder to check in with their own needs.
* Inconsistency and lack of routine will undermine their personal strength, so daily consistency is important. Additionally, they could have a weekly routine - like attending a place of worship. **This will counter their tendency to feel victimized by the randomness of life.** It will give them a sense of structure and discipline from within. Rather than floating in and out of other people's energy and consciousness, **a routine helps enhance their own identity.**",8,14,2020-04-19 01:54:42,astrology

It looks like we will continue to have pluto in capricorn till 2024, and with it, the continued rise of corporate greed and fascism. However, what are y’all opinion in the 2020 election? The democrats only need 4 seats to flip the senate, and even if Trump wins, he will be impeached and removed 20 mins into inauguration day. Will the 2020 election continue to see the societal destructive trends of pluto in Cap or will this be the first turn towards the Pluto in Aquarius age.

Edit: I think there is a automatic focus in Trump himself and not on the societal influences that make Trump possible. The last time Pluto was in Capricorn, we saw the American AND French Revolutions. In France, there was the mass extermination of the elite class. America had a king removed. Pluto in Capricorn forever changed the world as it was known. My question is simple: will 2020 see a beginning of a societal trend towards economic equity or do we wait for 2024 when Pluto enters Aquarius.",29,27,2020-04-18 22:19:06,astrology

The modern novel is characterized by introspection, access to the characters' inner thoughts and emotions, and the characters' internal selves as the drivers of the narrative. Sounds pretty Piscean. 

Now as we transition into the Aquarian age I wonder if anyone might speculate about what kind of shift in literature this age might bring.

Obviously anyone is into astrology to various degrees - I've just recently tried to dive into the details of it all a lot more however, I am very interested in science which is holding me back due to the amount of scientists that turn their nose up at it.
I have no judgement here. Genuinely. I don't have an opinion on whether astrology is real or not. I have researched the science behind astrology and what I unfortunately found was that hardly any people have tried to fact check astrology and also that most astronomers completely dismiss it. I know there is a couple of scientists that support astrology but that's all. Why such a small number?
I realise a lot of people won't be concerned by this but I struggle to make sense of everything even though it seems to hit the nail on the head every damn time! 
I am quite a spiritual and curious person (not religious as such) but also very into science. Astrology just doesn't make sense to me which really holds me back from learning more or feeling like I really understand what is going on.
For example, why are the signs of the zodiac classified as they are? Is there something more to it than someone once deciding to pick out certain stars into a pattern and that was that? Or is there some more logical methodology which has given meaning to the constellations as we classify them today? There is so much meaning given to the symbols used in astrology but where has that come from? 

So I'm curious as to what you guys believe about what astrology is and where it has come from? What validates it to you? Why do you follow it and trust it? 
Just to reiterate I have no judgement. I believe in Astrology because the more I learn the more it resonates with me but I just can't get my head around the practicalities of it.

EDIT: Just want to add that I do have a personal relationship with astrology. It has helped me immensely and I find it very useful and unnervingly accurate ha! But I'm also very curious about it.",53,22,2020-04-18 00:11:45,astrology
1527,"Explaining the concept of Exaltation / Domicile / Detriment / Fall in placements. What these seem to REALLY mean. Skip to the last paragraph to see a huge point if you’re not reading all of this. Thoughts?

&amp;nbsp;

A placement is “Exalted” when it is communicated as easy to understand because of the world’s way of seeing things. A placement is “Domicile” when it translates as a common and smooth understanding to the world. A placement is “Detriment” when it does not translate as a common and smooth understanding to the world. A placement is “Falling” when it is misunderstood and cannot be easily communicated because of the world’s way of seeing things.

&amp;nbsp;

Here’s an example of Exaltation / Domicile / Detriment / Fall in Sun signs:

&amp;nbsp;

The placement of your Sun sign has to do with the ego, what you want, some of your goals, and how you *want* to be noticed. It’s sort of like how you demand respect and keep an ego.

&amp;nbsp;

Leo Sun wants to feel superior in every situation socially, constantly making mental connections to themselves of why they are validated and why they are superior. Leo Sun wants to be seen as “king of the jungle” when its ego is taking its control. This is commonly seen in today’s world and society as understood smoothly, as in, it “makes sense” to society to act like a Leo Sun might act when it comes to having an ego. 

&amp;nbsp;

The Sun is “Detriment” in the sign Aquarius because Aquarius focuses on the state of society, the world, innovation, and equality. It acts detached, but has an ego in the sense that it doesn’t want its own goals to ever control itself. Aquarius Sun uses their ego, in a sense, for the sake of humanity and its own goals. This does not translate to the world / the majority of today’s society as being smoothly understood in terms of having an ego. 

&amp;nbsp;

Sun in Leo is seen as “Domicile” because, in the way of the world and society today, it might commonly be seen as understood smoothly, in terms of having an ego. Leo Sun can always feel a loss of control over its own ego when it feels invalidated or threatened in terms of its status as superior. Leo Sun focuses on itself because its ego will take control and be seen as a force to be validates and seen as worthy, maybe superior.

&amp;nbsp;

Exaltation / Domicile / Detriment / Fall seems to involve the concept of being understood or misunderstood, as in, no placement necessarily has more benefits or less benefits. For example, Libra Sun is seen as “Falling” and Aries Sun is seen as “Exalted”, which seems to have to do with the idea that the state of the world / society currently, more commonly, believes that an ego is more smoothly understood in Aries, and misunderstood in Libra. If the majority of the world / society misunderstood the Aries Sun ego, it would be “Falling”. If the more common belief of the world’s understanding of an ego was Libra, it would be “Exalted”.

&amp;nbsp;

Exaltation / Domicile / Detriment / Falling involves the most common beliefs of the world / society and makes a placement “Exalted” if it can be understood smoothly in terms of what the placement involves. Because of the way of society and the world today, libra Sun would be seen as “Falling” because it lacks the common understanding of focusing on themselves in order to maintain an ego. This is what makes a “Falling” placement “Falling”, in relevance to the Sun. This is the same with every celestial body / placement due to the most common way of understanding for the world and society.

&amp;nbsp;

A measure of Sun signs from Exalted to Domicile to Detriment to Falling would, in theory, be based on the more common views of the world and society. The concept that placements have any more benefits or less benefits is false, as this has to do with the state of human culture in today’s word and society.

&amp;nbsp;

Here’s another example, Moon in Scorpio is seen as “Falling”. This seems to be because Moon in Scorpio’s benefits come from intense emotions and coldness. Without allowing people to affect their emotions at all, Scorpio Moon acts “cold” and focuses on what’s right through how a person should be treated due to human psychology / feelings. This placement has benefits through what seems to be its vast human emotional understanding, tendency toward psychological analyses, and the concept of how to stay cold enough from allowing your emotions to be affected by other things and other humans.

&amp;nbsp;

This is seen as “Falling” because of the majority / the most common of beliefs in the world and society currently. It could and would be the opposite and Scorpio Moon could be seen as “Exalted” depending on the majority of the state of the world and society’s beliefs.

&amp;nbsp;

All placements have benefits, and Exaltation / Domicile / Detriment / Fall involves how easily understood or misunderstood placements are to the most of the world / society. All placements are beneficial even with “Fall”, “Detriment”, “Domicile”, or “Exaltation”.",5,5,2020-04-18 05:38:35,astrology

Notice i say *feel* because thats what Pisces is all about. Their logic is swayed by *feelings* and their own inner world. I find myself and other pisces mercury’s struggle with overthinking/anxiety. Its as if they are too susceptible to their ENVIRONMENT, and when in a toxic environment, its easy for them to become intoxicated. 
It feels like im constantly in a daze (a lonely daze) because its easy for pisces to be a martyr and feel sorry for themselves, or that the world revolves around them. I find unevolved pisces energy cant SEE the big picture (like aquarius for example, can) and instead they only see what they WANT to see based off their imagination.
Its like being in a constant vortex? 


Pisces Venus is also considered an exalted placement but I for one think its also very challenging. Love is complicated, and Pisces is willing to explore love, and have unconditional love, but they also are willing to suffer more than whats necessary. Again, UNHEALTHY venus pisces will literally MAKE themselves suffer at times because they need to feel like theyre being that martyr, fighting a good fight, and if theyre not suffering are they really loving????

1540,"The key to Saturn transits Is patience. Saturn is very unrelenting. But what ppl don't realize is Saturn is mainly self imposed. Planets that come after Mars or the personal planets are reactive. It's the world around us reacting to our own actions. It's out of our control yet still impacted by our decisions. Pretty much, it'll happen regardless. Saturn, Saturn is conclusive. As is Mars and Pluto and combining them gives a person killer instincts. Not in the brutal way but very much in a finalizing way. And with Saturn, he closes useless chapters. Pluto closes destructive chapters. Mars closes whatever chapter he chooses. But they all end things.

With Saturn you have to be patient. To have to let the storm pass. You have to take care of business, do what has to be done so you can lighten your load. But you still have to deal with the ramifications. I see that now as Saturn is transiting my moon until it moves back to Capricorn. It opposes my leo moon. Let me tell ya, I'm lonely, a lil depressed and just agitated. But with the moon we often reflect. And with Saturn, we are buried alive. My emotions are doing just that. But you have to be patient. The storm always passes as does Saturn. Saturn offers strength and wisdom by cutting you off. You are cut off from what you deem important. And when you are all alone, all you can do is think. But you have to do more than that because destruction with Saturn can be hard to stop. He is habitual by nature and uses repetition for his method. 


But just be patient. It's a test of virtue. Like Hercules who I feel is also represented by Saturn, he is a task completer. He finishes the job and gives his all. Cronos, was not always bad. it was his fear of karma that consumed him. Before that, he ruled with Grace and honesty. That's the flip side to Saturn. But he comes to add depth, wisdom and strength. He comes to uproot things, untangle weeds and allow for growth. He removes restrictions by showing them. At this time, I must grow but when I do.......
It will be powerful. I slipped into some very bad habits But I can overcome them. All it takes is effort. 



So I will March down this path...... alone, hurt, angry. But these are all emotions that I must uproot so I can be emotionally calm, stable and at peace. I wish I knew how this ends but I don't. But I have been on the positive side of a Saturn transit and when I was patient and controlled.....the benefits were just....amazing.

1541,"The Sacred Riana I saw her performances both on Asia’s Got Talent and America’s Got Talent, and though I was disturbed and scared a couple of times, I found them sort of cool.

   Out of curiosity, I looked up her chart because I found it interesting how she managed to develop her craft in a country that’s still, at least superficially, quite dominated by the Abrahamic religions (Indonesia).

   I thought she would most certainly be a Scorpio sun and / or with heavy Pluto influence in her personal planets. Turns out she’s actually a Cancer sun (same sign as me), but I was right about the Plutonic influence. I don’t know her time of birth so I don’t know if her moon’s in Sagittarius or Capricorn, nor her rising, so I can only use 12 noon. 

   I have to say that despite her performances being scary and all that, to me she poses a kind of dark and mysterious sexuality which I must admit, turns me on (despite me not having any major Pluto aspects to my own personal planets).


   Forgive me, I don’t know how to post images yet so I would be glad if someone can kindly show me:

12 noon, July 13, 1992. Jakarta, Indonesia.

Sun 21.03 Cancer

Moon 3.25 Capricorn

Mercury 15.38 Leo

Venus 29.11 Cancer

Mars 20.35 Taurus

Jupiter 11.42 Virgo

Saturn 16.35 Aquarius (R)

Uranus 15.48 Capricorn (R)

Neptune 17.29 Capricorn (R)

Pluto 20.15 Scorpio (R)



I suspect from her performances and her physical appearance that’s it’s very likely she’s Scorpio rising, which would most certainly place her moon in Capricorn.


Without knowing her time of birth:

Sun Conjunct Venus

Sun Sextile Mars

Sun Opposition Uranus

Sun Opposition Neptune

Sun Trine Pluto


Moon Trine Mars (possible)

Moon Trine Jupiter (possible)

Moon Conjunct Uranus

Moon Conjunct Neptune

Moon Sextile Pluto (unlikely)


Mercury Square Mars

Mercury Opposition Saturn

Mercury Square Pluto


(Not sure if her Venus is aspected)

Mars Square Saturn

Mars Trine Uranus

Mars Trine Neptune

Mars Opposition Pluto




As I suspected, she does indeed have a heavy Pluto influence (dark, mysterious, occult) with Pluto aspecting 3 / 5 of her personal planets, 2 of these are also challenging aspects (Mercury Square Pluto and Mars Opposition Pluto). I would not be surprised if she hasn’t Pluto Conjunct her Ascendant.

   All of the oppositions to Uranus I interpret as playing the major part in her eccentric tastes and image, she wants to revolutionize, she wants to be unique, but this kind of uniqueness can come off as being hard to stomach for a lot of people at first. The challenging aspects to Neptune might point to some kind of identity disassociation, or should I say a reflection of her more than one, or even multiple conflicting identities and fantasies that she is trying to portray through her magic shows. She’s clearly upset, disillusioned about something in the physical world we live in, something that penetrates deep within her.",3,1,2020-04-18 01:36:49,astrology
1542,"Defining the Essential Dignities and Debilities? I am still relatively new to astrology (3 years total but only 1 year of more intentional learning). I’ve just finished studying the house systems, modern vs traditional astrology principles, and aspects. The essential dignities seem to be the next step for me. However, I’ve had a hard time figuring out where to start. I usually begin learning a new topic by defining key terms but I’ve found it nearly impossible to find resources that are consistent, contain the information I’m looking for, or use terms that I’m familiar with.

I’m looking to come up with concise definitions of Domicile, Exaltation, Detriment, and Fall in laypersons terms to give myself a launchpad, and more importantly, how to apply that knowledge. For example, I’ve repeatedly seen Domicile being called the most powerful dignity as if that really *means* anything to someone who is new to this topic. Also, I’ve had confusion as to how exactly Domicile and Exaltation, for example (given they’re both dignities, not debilities), differ from each other in the context of actually reading a natal chart.

1543,"Planets ""Illuminating"" Houses - Question Hi y'all

I'm sure you've all seen astrology articles written where a planet enters a sign, and ""illuminates"" a specific house... like this from astrotwins Scorpio horoscope for April:

&gt;A perfect day to let down your walls arrives on April 7, when the annual Libra full moon illuminates your twelfth house of closure, healing and surrender.

So when I look at a chart like one [here](https://www.astrologyland.com/free_chart_wheel/YourFreeChart.aspx), the moon is in Libra, but it looks like it's in the 4th house? How does it ""illuminate"" the 12th house and how would I be able to tell something like that?

Neptune has a tendency to oscillate between idealism &amp; imagination and escapism &amp; delusion.

with Neptune, the lines are blurred between the dream world &amp; deception. the relationship begins like a fantasy: reinforced by the idealized version of what “could” be.

red flags aren’t visible through rose coloured glasses.

here are some examples of how it could manifest:

* romanticizing partner; idealized perception of their character
* self-sacrifice or over-giving; the needs of one partner are neglected
* lack of boundaries, or minimal efforts to communicate &amp; enforce boundaries
* extreme conflict avoidance
* gaslighting: psychological abuse to destroy ones sense of reality.

Neptune’s positive associations could be an extremely spiritual, compassionate, or creative partnership. other-worldly romance can be grounded in reality if boundaries are enforced &amp; needs are met.

*if any of this resonates for you, look to your chart for the following indicators as a starting point:*

* *outer planet(s) in the 7th house*
* *outer planet(s) forming hard aspects to the Descendant*
* *outer planet(s) forming hard aspects to the ruler of the 7th house*

*synastry or composite charts may illuminate this dynamic in the context of a singular relationship you've experienced, rather than a perpetual pattern. in this case, placements in angular houses or hard aspects involving the outer planets may play a role.*

Plutonian relationships are extremely intense. Pluto wants everything, or nothing at all. everything exists in black &amp; white: the relationship is either incredible, or absolutely terrible. sometimes, it can involve extreme power struggles.

at its worst, Pluto doesn’t let things go: a suspicion, an emotion, a fight, or an ex partner. Pluto can be quick to self-destruct, thinking “they can’t destroy us if I do first.”

a few ways this could manifest:

* obsessive &amp; possessive thoughts or behaviors
* catastrophizing: cognitive distortion, thinking of the worst case scenario
* intense infatuation: expecting all needs to be met by one person
* compulsive self-sabotaging behaviors
* extreme emotional states

constructive uses of Plutonian energy would be developing ones personal power. dialectics are the saving grace for Pluto, as balance isn’t an option. learn to let extremes coexist simultaneously.

*again, the same rules apply. look to your chart for the following indicators as a starting point:*

* *outer planet(s) in the 7th house*
* *outer planet(s) forming hard aspects to the Descendant*
* *outer planet(s) forming hard aspects to the ruler of the 7th house*

*synastry or composite charts may illuminate this dynamic in the context of a singular relationship you've experienced, rather than a perpetual pattern. in this case, placements in angular houses or hard aspects involving the outer planets may play a role.*

1588,"Quick Comprehensive Guide to Gemstones in Vedic Astrology At the outset, I wish to state that only 9 Gemstones are considered in Vedic (Sidereal) Astrology.

In the image below, you can see in which finger a particular gemstone in worn. However, if due to professional commitments, gemstone can't be worn in finger, it can be worn in neck as in a locket as well.

[Gemstones and Fingers](https://preview.redd.it/oeof48f3wss41.png?width=680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a43e914e8b2d07885391476863f9140d3591aa6)

Different Schools of Vedic Astrology follow different methods to prescribe gemstones. One astrologer might differ from other in issuing gemstones.

The Gemstone associated to each Planet is as under:-

&amp;#x200B;

|*S. No.*|*Planet*|*Gemstone*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|Sun|Ruby|
|2|Moon|Pearl|
|3|Mercury|Emerald|
|4|Venus|Diamond|
|5|Mars|Red Coral|
|6|Jupiter|Yellow Sapphire|
|7|Saturn|Blue Sapphire|
|8|Rahu (Dragon's Head)|Hessonite|
|9|Ketu (Dragon's Tail)|Cat's Eye|

&amp;#x200B;

Various Schools of Vedic Astrology follow different theories to choose Metals in which gemstones should be studded. However, I will tell one of such methods.

 Metals for:

* Sun/Jupiter = Gold
* Moon = Silver
* Mars = Copper

If Sun or Jupiter is good in chart, gemstone can be worn in Gold.

If Sun/Jupiter are not good, but Moon is good, gemstone can be worn in Silver.

If Sun/Jupiter/Moon are all not good in chart and Mars is good, Gemstone can be worn in Copper.

If all of Sun, Jupiter, Moon and Mars do not give good results in chart, then Gemstones can be studded in alloy of five metals.  Precious gemstones like Diamond, Blue Sapphire, Emerald etc. are studded only in Gold because of its strong gripping power so that gemstones are not lost during daily usage.

Some people get studded Blue Sapphire/Diamond in Silver too as it has decent grip, and Silver does not become dull after sometime. But studding precious gemstones in Copper or Alloy of Five metals is risky as Gemstone can slip from loose grip, and Copper becomes dull in appearance.

So, even if Mars is good in chart, do not stud Diamond/Blue Sapphire/Emerald etc. in Copper.

Get them studded in Gold/Silver only.  Prescribing metal depends on schools of Astrology but nothing stops us from applying practical mind.

Pearl is not studded in Gold because if Moon is good in chart, silver automatically qualifies as a metal. Same with others. 

Substitutes of gemstones or other stones like Amethyst, Zircan etc. do not have any astrological powers, so do not count them among the 9 gemstones. You can keep wearing them, as they at least do not harm.

Some schools of Astrology prescribe gemstones for specific period, some for lifetime and some for specific purpose. (e.g. Marriage).  I believe wearing incorrect gemstone harms the native, so better to not wear any if unsure. Some gemstones may help in one field but harm in another aspect.

Finally, I do not believe in testing effect of gemstones by keeping them under pillow or in pocket. Whether they would suit or not is evident from birth chart. Some astrologers professing Vedic astrology recommend to testing suitability of gemstones this way before asking the native to wear them.

People who do not know their birth time or are unsure of correct birth time should NEVER wear any of 9 gemstones mentioned above even if it's cheap.

Weight:  Gemstone above 5 Carats can be worn. Diamond should be of minimum 30 cents. Person's Weight is irrelevant.

A gemstone can be worn for any period of time of it is fine. It doesn't expire or doesn't need re-energization. Some schools/texts believe otherwise. Gemstone already worn by a person can be worn by other person provided the gemstone suits person who is to wear it.

Days on which gemstones should be worn:

&amp;#x200B;

|*Gemstone*|*Weekday*|
|:-|:-|
|Pearl|Monday|
|Red Coral/Cat's Eye|Tuesday|
|Emerald|Wednesday|
|Yellow Sapphire|Thursday|
|Diamond|Friday|
|Blue Sapphire/Hessonite|Saturday|

1590,"why outer planets don't make good sign rulers, and why 1st house does not equal aries, 2nd house does not equal taurus, etc. So, being a part of the astrological community - and working professionally as a traditional astrologer - when I talk about rulerships or houses, there is no doubt that someone will quickly reply with ""But you're wrong. uranus rules aquarius!"" or referring to things as ""Scorpio/the 8th house is about... \_\_\_"" 

   this is a super touchy subject, and people tend to get a bit upset when told that as a solar pisces they are actually jupiter ruled and not neptune ruled, etc. 

Things get taken personally, feelings get hurt, resentments get built, and its just not productive at all, and both the traditional rulership person and modern rulership person walk away feeling worse than they did before.  So I thought I would make a post talking about WHY traditional astrologers use the rulerships and house associations they use.

   So first of all, the reason why traditional astrologers still do not use outer planets (Uranus Neptune Pluto) as rulers is NOT because they don't ""believe in"" or use these planets.

  First of all, in traditional astrology, we classify the relationship between a sign and a planet using what is known as essential dignities &amp; debilities. In traditional astrology, there are not just rulerships, but several different types of relationships that a planet and a sign can have.  For the sake of simplicity here, we will focus on rulerships, but here is a table explaining the traditional dignities and debilities. [http://www.skyscript.co.uk/dig2.html](http://www.skyscript.co.uk/dig2.html)

So, I will say that when the outer planets are used, Uranus does find its dignity in Aquarius, Neptune in Pisces, and Pluto in Scorpio, (they also have signs in which they are exalted, in fall, in detriment too) so there is a relationship between Scorpio, Pisces, Aquarius and the outer planets! But, the outer planets do not RULE these signs, or any signs at all, and there is a reason. The reason is that if we take Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto, and use them as the rulers of signs, it messes up the complex system of dignities and debilities.  

   Here is one reason: with the exception of the luminaries (the Sun = Leo and Moon = Cancer) each of the other 5 planets rule 2 zodiac signs - we have: 

Mercury - Gemini &amp; Virgo,

 Venus - Taurus &amp; Libra, 

Mars - Aries &amp; Scorpio, 

Jupiter - Sagittarius &amp; Pisces,

 Saturn - Capricorn &amp; Aquarius. 

   thus, if we add in the outer planets of uranus, neptune, and pluto as rulers, knowing they are not luminaries who can get away with ruling 1 sign - we would have to assign the 3 outer planets 2 signs each. No one has been able to figure out a way to do this that actually makes sense. 

Now onto the houses: in traditional astrology - 

  the 12 houses being ruled as 1H = aries, 2h= taurus is a baseless modern disambiguation. there are 0 source texts that define the houses this way. 

certain planets have what is called a ""joy"" in certain houses -and that is the closest we come to houses being consistently associated with signs or planets. Here is a great paper by astrologer Chris Brennan that talks about the joys, and the themes of all the houses. [http://www.hellenisticastrology.com/the-planetary-joys.pdf](http://www.hellenisticastrology.com/the-planetary-joys.pdf)

The joys are as follows:

Mercury's joy is in the 1st house, the Moon's joy is in the 3rd house, Venus' joy is in the 5th house, Mars' joy is in the 6th house, the Sun's joy is in the 9th house, Jupiter's joy is in the 11th, and Saturn's joy is in the 12th house. 

the other houses that do not have a joy just do not have a planetary joy - no planet necessarily ""rejoices"" in houses 2, 4, 7, 8, and 10. 

No one knows exactly where the ""1st house = aries, 2nd house = taurus, 3rd house = gemini"" idea really took root. My theory is that it seemed easy, there were 12 houses and 12 signs so - why not line them up? Its a totally modern creation heavily utilized within pop astrology as a way to simply break down the houses. But technically, it is inaccurate, with no basis in any astrological source texts. 

   And if you want to say that the source texts of astrology make no sense, and are old and dusty and nonsensical and our modern intuition has rendered these ideas archaic and inane? Maybe read a few traditional astrology texts first. Sometimes the wording or spelling can be a little....huh? at first, but I have found so so much more value in these texts than on tumblr blogs or instagram. (not that i don't have some favorite IG &amp; tumblr astrologers!)

   It is simple to do the houses this way, and shit, it was my introductory idea about the houses too. But as I read charts, I began to find that it didn't make too much sense. Why do we need two different things that both mean the same thing as Aries? As well as this, this idea about the houses and about the outer planets as rulers have caused people to begin to mishmash the house meanings, sign meaning, and planet meanings together, losing the distinct value and original ideas about each separate concept. A great book to read on this is called ""The Houses: Temples of the Sky"" by Deborah Houlding. (I had a free pdf version but can't find it. 

Now, Houses do still have rulers, but it changes depending on the orientation of the houses in each natal chart. Whatever your first house is, the ruler of that sign is the ruler of your 1st house, and then the ruler of your 2nd house sign is that ruler of that house, and so on. (ex/ Cancer ascendant = 1st house ruler = moon, 2nd house is leo, ruler = sun, 3rd house is virgo, ruler = mercury, and so on. PS. I prefer the oldest house system, whole signs, over the popular Placidus, but that's a story for another time, or for the comments or something. )

 Another distinction to make is that the outer planets move soooo slowly that the sign they are in makes 0 personal or individual distinctions about the querent themselves. (Uranus takes 7 years to move through one sign, sometimes longer. Neptune takes about 14 years, Pluto takes anywhere between 14 and 30 years. So, if anything, when talking about something like ""Uranus in Capricorn"" we should look at it as the ""Uranus in Capricorn generation."" Similarly, aspects between two outer planets, like Neptune conjunct Uranus, Neptune sextile Pluto, etc., do not have personal significance. 

Things that WILL make an outer planet notable within an individual personality are: 

1) an outer planet closely conjunct the chart angles (AC or DC, IC or MC). Just being in the angular houses (1, 4, 7, or 10) does not have nearly as much significance as when they are actually closely conjunct one of these 4 axis points. 

2) An outer planet involved in a MAJOR aspect (conjunct, square, trine, opposite, sextile) to an inner planet (It also has to be within orb. Neptune being 8-10 degrees away from the Sun/Moon etc. is not a conjunction, or being 7-10 degrees away from an exact square/trine to the Sun/Moon etc. is not a relevant square/trine, whatever, either.)  

I just wanted to put some distinct information out here on why traditional astrologers say the things they do about rulerships and houses. If this is strongly worded, I apologize, I just want to clear things up a bit. 

   If anyone else has anything to add: put it below! And please, let's keep it civil. All astrologers, amateur, professional, modern, traditional, uranian, etc., are extremely bright and valuable!

TLDR; the outer planets don't rule inner planets because all inner planets (other than the luminaries, aka sun/moon) rule 2 different signs, so if we add the outer planets in, it muddles everything.

The houses being lined up with the signs i.e. aries = 1H, taurus = 2H - is a modern creation of convenience. The rulers of houses change depending on your chart (if your ascendant/1H is taurus, the ruler of 1H = venus, 2h=mercury, and so on.)

1595,"Narcos, Organized crime, astrology, and my observation. One of my favorite shows on TV is Narcos, something about the way it is directed and how it plays out really made it a show I binge watched this (yeah late to the party!) for the first time. To some degree, the highest level of success with organized crime became something I ended up reading about (and intend to leave it to just reading because in the end almost all of these guys get busted) a lot. 

It is fair to say that in the turn of the century, the main type of organized crime groups that have been the most successful are drug cartels. I say recognized meaning I know how everyone wants to say the Catholic Church or law enforcement are the real criminals but I am talking more about recognized criminal syndicates here.

I decided to look at natal charts of some of the most infamous cartel lords, mainly from Narcos but others from reading and found how a lot of them really tied into astrology.

**Let's start with the king of organized crime himself, Pablo Escobar.**

I was surprised to find that Escobar was a Sagittarius but then some of his antics started to slowly make sense to me, especially bringing in wild animals from abroad to his personal zoo. The Aries moon is what time and time again showed how he was impulsive but then, what about the long-term success in such a cut-throat game. Escobar had a Mars in Virgo, adding cold and calculated to a violent nature lusting for violence. Now add in a Mars conjunct Saturn, both in Virgo, you have someone who can actually play strategically. Now add Gustavo (Capricorn) as extra brains behind the organization, this fueled the success that Pablo had.

What I think really put him over the top? **Pluto trines with INNER PLANETS, so many of them, and Pluto sitting in a potentially exalted sign.** I hear that while Pluto is domiciled in Scorpio, it is considered to be exalted in Leo which kind of makes sense. Leo is associated with the crown, ambition, and gaining power. I have found the sign to among the most strategic while also driven by an egotistical lust for power, it knows how to climb the heights and operate in cut-throat situations. Some claim that Leo also sits in the highest dignity in Mars, not so jolly as pop astrologers claim after all but I'll talk more about that.

Despite the favorable aspects for strategy, it was ultimately Escobar having an Aries moon which I believe led to him destroying so much to the point that it all turned on him. Then add to that the very Pluto in an ego-driven sign which hungers for war. Enough about Escobar though, moving on.

**The Cali Cartel, Gilberto (Aquarius) vs his brother Miguel (Leo). The very season of Narcos that brought me to actually make this post.**

As much as I have talked about Escobar, I actually found the Cali Cartel more interesting simply because they made a lot more money and had more control on the international drug trade in the 90s. I was most amazed at the difference in persona between Gilberto versus his brother Miguel. Gilberto was the chess player in control but one that preferred bribing to violence, no need to go to war with anyone. As the older brother, he showed more long-term vision and strategy even though the surrender ultimately did him in.

What changed my view was actually how much the cartel changed one Gilberto was locked up and Miguel (the Leo) was in charge, in typical Leo fashion, things got extremely bloody and violent. Violence, intimidation, threats, wiping out the opposition, and conquest became the new language. You even saw the brothers argue and not get along being that they were of opposing signs. Miguel did not want to spread the wealth, to him, it was his cartel who were top and everyone else was there to watch, they had to know who was boss.

You also had Chepe (Libra) and Pacho (Virgo), I was amazed by Pacho given how calculated he was in typical Virgo fashion. I found that unlike Escobar, the Cali Cartel avoided violence unless they absolutely needed it. The biggest culprit in them changing their ways was obviously Miguel and his Leo energy which made things violent, ruthless, and war like. Compare this with Gilberto who thought progressively in Aquarius fashion, why all the violence if we can all find a creative way to just quit and start new lives? 

**Then we go to Narcos Mexico with Felix.**

Moving forward, I noticed as I looked more into Mexican Drug Cartels which are considered more cruel than the Colombian ones, there was so much Capricorn energy. Who else to start this than Felix himself, I noticed it throughout the series. Driven, cut-throat, and almost no respect to anyone around him which ironically did him in. As disliked as he was among others, I noticed how compared to other crime lords he was a lot more calculated. The move to go after a DEA agent ultimately cost him everything but outside of that, he was constantly making all the strategic chess moves. 

You had Rafa who was the one that went after Kiki the DEA agent and I do not have the bandwidth yet to talk about his chart, this post is already too long!

**Moving forward and observations.**

Immediately, despite the associations with the underworld, I was shocked to find a lack of Scorpio energy in the cartel world. I mean it was there but not nearly to the extent I thought it would be. I found that other nurturing water signs like Pisces and Cancers rivaled Scorpio for dominance in that world. Maybe there is something to be said for where Pluto is exalted and Scorpio gets a bad rap a bit too much.

What surprised me was that there are so many fire signs that climb to the top of the world of organized crime, famously El Chapo in recently memory who is an Aries but also Amado who was a Sagg. I did not expect this, I thought that it would be earth signs that would dominate a lot. 

Then I noticed as I looked at the most cruel criminals in recent history in the world of organized crime, particularly the cartels you hear the worst stories about in recent news, what sign came up a lot? Capricorns by a large mile followed by Cancer and then Scorpio. 

I feel like there is a certain type of sadistic and cruel nature to Capricorn that cannot be rivaled, an almost cold-hearted demeanor you cannot contend with. A certain kind of evil to the sign that manifests in charts that have too much of it that at its worst, gives you a first class display of human cruelty. After all, it is a sign associated with Satan.

Sorry if this question has been asked before/if it's common knowledge.

1597,"URANUS &amp; TOXIC RELATIONSHIPS even though I use traditional rulership, I find the outer planets deeply important in chart readings. in my studies, I’ve observed a few parallels between the placement &amp; condition of Neptune, Pluto &amp; Uranus as an indicator for patterns of toxic relationships. 

these indicators could apply to an individual birth chart, in which case the native would bring these tendencies into their relationships until they adapt their behaviours. alternatively, this could occur only in the context of a relationship, in which case relationship astrology could provide some insight.

let's start with Uranus. 

Uranian relationships are volatile: they’re unpredictable &amp; rapidly changing. they can result from a learned association between affection &amp; a chaotic environment. as Uranus yearns for liberty, it can express as having (or pursuing someone with) a fear of commitment.

subsequent secure, healthy relationships tend to provoke anxiety as safety is unfamiliar. there may be (un)intentional efforts to provoke conflict &amp; disrupt the peace. 

a few ways this could manifest:

* being addicted to the chase
* repeatedly breaking up &amp; getting back together; frequent ""breaks""
* pursuing emotionally unavailable partners
* an internalized, persistent urge for freedom &amp; independence 
* confusing chaos &amp; dysfunction with passion &amp; excitement

if one can learn to overcome these patterns, healthier manifestations include dating eccentric individuals, or having “unconventional” relationships (e.g. age difference, open relationships, distinct cultural backgrounds, etc.). 

note that Uranus is associated with what society deems unconventional, rebellious, revolutionary, or challenging the status quo. as Uranus is relative to the current social landscape, the partnership may be subject to oppressive forces. this isn’t meant to judge certain relationship dynamics, but recognize the difficulty of being in a relationship that goes against the “norm.”

if any of this resonates for you, look to your chart for the following indicators as a starting point:

* outer planet(s) in the 7th house
* outer planet(s) forming hard aspects to the Descendant
* outer planet(s) forming hard aspects to the ruler of the 7th house

synastry or composite charts may illuminate this dynamic in the context of a singular relationship you've experienced, rather than a perpetual pattern. in this case, placements in angular houses or hard aspects involving the outer planets may play a role.

this is part one of a three part series, next we'll explore Plutonian relationships. i[f you want to read the rest of the series, click here](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-7xJ7SBV4j/). otherwise, wait until later this week &amp; I'll post it to reddit :)",22,20,2020-04-14 06:19:10,astrology

1602,"The Ascendant through the signs (This is based on what I’ve specifically read and noticed about each sign as of now)

&amp;nbsp;

The Ascendant is among the specific three sign placements that I usually notice others mention *a lot*: the “big three” signs (Sun sign / Moon sign / Ascendant sign). The importance of any placement and sign isn’t necessarily the same, and I’ve read a number of times how these “big three” are written or talked about with the intention of finding an opinion of which one is the most effective or which “matters more”. I might do other analyzing posts like this one for Sun and Moon signs, and this one is for the Ascendant.

&amp;nbsp;

The Ascendant is about how you see the world and how the world sees you. This is what these theoretical exaltations from “greatest to least” are based on. Again, this is superficial and there’s always more factors.

&amp;nbsp;

1. Aries Ascendant (sees the world as a war zone, but likes to fight. fears relying on others and losing their independence / own opportunities)
2. Taurus Ascendant (sees the world as already peaceful, in a way. is logical and is self-nurturing, wants comfort and sees it as possible)
3. Gemini Ascendant (wants to be seen as smart and quick and sees the world as fun, exciting. fears losing curiosity and their knowledge)
4. Cancer Ascendant (believes the world is deep and emotional. sees the world as their home and fears feeling like they don’t belong anywhere)
5. Leo Ascendant (wants to rule the world with their ego and needs validation and attention. wants to be seen by the world and validated.)
6. Virgo Ascendant (focuses on details of the world before engaging with it, fears imperfection. needs to feel useful and knowledgeable)
7. Libra Ascendant (sees the world as a utopia and sees the never-ending potential of beauty the world has to offer. fears a lack of balance, chaos, and competition)
8. Scorpio Ascendant (sees the world as always wanting to hurt them. big issues with loss / fear of others ruining their life somehow)
9. Sagittarius Ascendant (sees life as an adventure and an extravagant experience. fears losing their sense of freedom)
10. Capricorn Ascendant (sees the world as a ladder to success and fears never fulfilling their duty and reaching a high social status)
11. Aquarius Ascendant (feels a need to never conform and always stay “different” / unique to feel like they matter)
12. Pisces Ascendant (views the world in a delusional way where all people aren’t as bad as they seem even if they are)

I understand that there are aspects related to fame and career which create status based sense of popularity but what really interests me is the aspects that give someone that magnetic and warm personality and gregariousness that creates someone who is popular wherever they go and isn’t dependent on their social status. 

An example of this would be the person in high school who is genuinely popular and well liked but their popularity doesn’t come entirely from their looks or money (no Regina Georges) or that person who can go anywhere and other people just know them and like them. 

I would guess air signs lead the pack in being beneficial to social abilities and skills but I also think fire signs often tend to be pretty popular as well due to their ability to draw attention and their liveliness.

While I agree that the transition effects can, and are, being felt right now I also believe we are still a long time away from the beginning of the age according to the stars.

[Take a look at this image](https://i.imgur.com/kkLEzX4.png). You can see the three stages are pretty clear. The first stage will begin in ~150 years when the constellation of Aquarius first shares the ecliptic right ascension of 0 hours with Pisces. Technically during this stage, the sun will still be in front of Pisces during the spring equinox. It won't be until stage 2 that the sun will be in front of Aquarius during the equinox (i.e. the boundary of Aquarius intersects with the ecliptic coordinates RA: 0 hours, Dec: 0 degrees). During this stage Aquarius will still share the ecliptic right ascension of 0 hours with Pisces. The third stage is when Aquarius shares the spring equinox with no other zodiac constellation.

Stage 1 to stage 3 will take ~1,069 years. Could this be the 1,000-year period prophesied in Revelation 20? Who knows? Just an observation!

1619,"Tiger King Astrology! Hello,

So I watched that Netflix documentary: Tiger King and without searching I knew Jo Exotic has some Leo/Pisces combo. I got the Pisces sun right, he has cancer moon, unknown rising but I am Assuming Leo. Because they way he loves attention and trying to act like a star.

The thing is, is it safe to say that anyone who's an attention seeker with big ego is a Leo rising? Specially with the idea of posing with tigers gives a vibe of authority.

So I made this chart DOB and POB from google (5/March/1963, Kansas City, Kansas) I used 15:00 to make it a Leo rising

What do you think?

1620,"Understanding Scorpio: the reality of Joe Biden and Democrat establishment explained. I have long been a fan of astrology when it can be used to describe people and events, in other words when it is actually most relevant to us. One thing that has fascinated me when it comes to astrology is when it applies to politics, sports, competitive landscapes, and how it all ties into the modern times as a result.

Now I describe myself as a liberal and yes, as polarizing as it may be, a Bernie Bro. I wanted to actually make this post because I feel like through understanding Scorpio, for better or worse, I am able to understand what is really going on with the Democrat establishment and Joe Biden. Although Biden will be earning my vote come fall, I have others thoughts on whether or not he gets re-elected. 

For starters who have not seen Biden's chart, he has a lot of planets in Scorpio and I mean *a lot*. I believe it is close to a stellium. Hillary also was a Scorpio heavy chart as well. When I say Scorpio, I don't mean the sun sign, I mean an individual with a stellium or a Scorpio heavy chart.

*Do as I say, not as I do*

**If you want to truly understand Scorpio in its purest form, that is the saying you need to have engrained in your head.**

Scorpio methods for getting ahead or gaining power are subtle and more behind the scenes. Compared to an Aries Mars, a Scorpio Mars is more indirect and roundabout in its ways of getting ahead in life. Tactics such as guilt trips, making the other person feel bad for being ambitious, and taking the moral high ground are all too often the most common of ways in which a Scorpio heavy placement will get ahead. A Scorpio heavy individual will rely on two things to get ahead and ultimately win out:

1 - The other person is the type to feel guilty and almost go on the defensive, unraveling and becoming more apologetic for their actions. Now this worked to excellence when Biden debated Ryan and the more classy politicians who were too hung up on being seen as good honest people.

2 - None of your dirt gets out there as much, even if it does, it is overshadowed by the dirt of your opposition.

In other words, hush hush. Think of a dictatorship where a dictator can get away with murder but everyone else has to be on their best behavior. Such is the way a Scorpio placement attempts to court victory, take advantage of the moral nature of people and have them walk on eggshells. Once again, guilt trips and emotional blackmail are its weapon of choice.

You even see this in astrological circles with Scorpios parading themselves as the ""strongest sign"" and how they will dominate every other zodiac sign. Just google it, the desperation to be seen as the John Wick of the zodiac. I don't really hate the sign though given that I have a few placements in it, rather I am talking about the less developed version of it.

For a Scorpio, its an appearance. Look one way outwardly and another way in private to those who really do know you well, I'll talk more about this later. A scorpio relies on silencing the opposition, not really taking them on.

**Unfortunately, they are going against Trump.**

As much as I wanted Hillary to win so we can finally have a woman president, the reason Trump won is because he has no guilt and is not the apologetic type. To make matters even worse, Trump's chart which I will get to shortly, is a Scorpio's nightmare. Trump aired so much of Hilary's dirty laundry in his campaign that it put Hillary in a tough spot and in unfamiliar territory.

**Now let's talk about the unfamiliar territory for a Scorpio, being challenged.**

Scorpio heavy charts are not really used to being challenged and when they are in more of an open area with the crowd watching, they unravel. Scorpio placements thrive more in private, in the dark, and behind closed doors. A Scorpionic individual might rig aspects of the game to their favor so it is an easy path to victory for them. 

When the game is played more in an open arena like a debate or an area of high transparency, a Scorpionic individual tends to be in a weak setting. The reason is because a Scorpio chart relies on secrecy and does not really want people to know everything about it, hence the facade and trying to keep things private.

**As for Trump's chart.**

Even though astrologers have been drinking the Scorpio kool aid and calling it the ""strongest sign"" these days, I think that a number of signs just have its number. Gemini is one that comest to mind but also Leo and Capricorn. Trump has a lot of Gemini and Leo in his chart, this is why it is relevant.

Gemini and Leos will drag the competition out in the open.

Yes, they are very foolish and clownish signs but what people see is typically what they get. The signs are more open and outward performing signs who can defend themselves in public, they thrive in those settings. On top of that, they air everyone's dirty laundry.

Gemini is ruled by Mercury and represents the media, the word getting around. In other words, a Scorpio's absolute worst nightmare. 

Yes, dirt might continue to come out on a Gemini or Leo but they will defend it away with ease. People who love them will love them while those who hate them would have hated them anyways. A Scorpio is not good at doing that, they have a lot of skeletons in the closet that they cannot have getting out.

A Scorpio's worst nightmare is having to do a conference where they have to explain all of the dirt of their past, they live everyday to ensure that never happens. Unfortunately for Biden, I think he will have to do that this election and will end up being soundly defeated by Trump due to Trump having the heavy Gemini and Leo energy in his chart.",32,31,2020-04-13 03:41:11,astrology

aries :: boromir — he really did have the best intentions and i’m sure his heart was in the right place but the impulsive fuck of a human let his ego get the best of him and he literally tried to murder our beloved frodo and that’s all i have to say. ripskis 

taurus :: samwise — comfort based, food enthusiast, a little stubborn and incredibly loyal to those he cares for (frodo) shy and loving and soft. funnily enough he’s the one who enjoys cooking the food and he’s incredibly disappointed when they’re only left with lembas 

gemini :: mary and pippin — mischievous, theres two of them hehehe so they fit the twin archetype, they’re always having fun and they have v lighthearted personalities, trouble makers who aren’t sure how they got there or became part of the fellowship but they’re jus goin wit it 

cancer :: frodo — the calm in the storm, pretty laidback and relaxed in even the most unideal situations, pretty kept to himself and doesn’t enjoy conflict but he’s determined af. he’s hesitant with gollum at first but overtime accepts him into their clan with a nurturing attitude. also he has those big watery eyes 

leo :: gimli — loud and proud, warm-hearted and funny!!!! a little prideful and stubborn, doesn’t want anyone to see his failures or shortcomings so he puts up a lil bit of a facade but hes incredibly loyal and he’s willing to fight for those who he loves. HAIRY AF

virgo :: arwen — delicate mannerisms, pure intentions and an eye for detail. gives up her immortality for her love (living up to the 6h act of service or duty) a natural healer!!!!! she seems very innocent on the surface but she’s lowkey an elvish warrior bad bish 

libra :: lady galadriel — the peacemaker, a divine source of light who’s able to overrule all types of conflict. the fucking epitome of venusian energy, she basically has gandalf wrapped around her finger with her feminine magnetism LMAO

scorpio :: aragorn — he’s mysterious as fuck and he tends to rub people the wrong way or intimidate them only because they can’t figure him out, intense energy, literally summons the army of dead to fulfil an oath to the mortal (???? this is eighth house as fuck)

aquarius :: legolas — he’s clever, intelligent and always a few steps ahead of everyone but he has a lil bit of a god complex. typically remains indifferent and detached during conflict though he really struggles with gimli at first due to their ancestors rivalry and inflated egos (hence the leo/aquarius axis heheh)

1633,"Extraterrestrial Astrology - Ideas, implications and discussion * How will it be like to make a natal chart for a baby born on another planet?  How will it shape psychology? How will transits work for people who were born on Earth but visit those places?

* Will the new influences match with their names in all cases?

* What will be the influence of the Earth (Gaia/Terra) ? Maybe similar to Ceres, Venus, ?

* What will be the meaning of the planet that you live on? For example, what will Mars mean to you if you already live on Mars? It will no longer be a planet to be used on charts there!

* Will anything of the above distort sign rulerships? How?

Five case examples I can think about:

* Mercury. The closest planet to the Sun, has an orbit that is inside those of Venus and Earth, therefore, any aspect between planets, such as an opposition between Sun and Venus, is possible. Here, the Sun turns retrograde part of the time. Planets take longer to move across the houses than across the signs, and the sun only stays a few days on each sign (a day is longer than the year). Venus and Earth are very prominent.

* The Moon. The Earth always sit in the same house, which is entirely defined by location, not time. Earth slowly moves through the signs as the month-long lunar day goes on. Every other planet including the sun behaves similarly as it does on Earth.

* Mars. Mars has a year that is 687 days, therefore the sun takes about twice as long to transit each sign. Its day, however, is only 39 minutes longer. The Earth behaves in a manner similar to Venus does on Earth, and Mercury and Venus have tighter separations from the Sun. Mars’s two moons, Phobos and Deimos, complete an entire cycle on a matter of hours. Do their prominence and speed suggest that Fear and Dread will be prominent issues for Martian natives?

* Gas Giants' moons. In the case of the closest ones, the planets they orbit around occupy more than an entire sign. Rings are prominent, especially near Saturn. Fellow moons look quite prominent too, each one with a pair of transiting nodes, and each of the moons transiting the whole chart in a days to weeks, and retrograding every now and then. As on our own Moon, the planet never changes house, but it moves across the signs time as long as that moon takes an orbit. Eclipses are dramatic, and happen often. The Sun spends on each sign as long as the planet takes to transit them on terrestrial charts (1 year at jupiter, 2.5 at saturn, and so on). All the planets from Mercury to Mars (including Earth) are mostly conjunct the Sun.

* Extrasolar planets. Constellations as we know them are either distorted, or don’t exist at all. It is still possible to find a valid Aries point, and derive the signs from there. Another star with completely different properties dominates the sky, while our sun is nowhere to be seen. A set of strange planets with completely different cycles dominate the charts.",2,5,2020-04-12 20:49:31,astrology

1646,"The Planet Jupiter I felt compelled to write about my thoughts on the planet Jupiter for anyone who might be interested- the good and the bad. 

Imagine you're staring up at the stars or standing at the edge of the Grand Canyon overlooking the *vast* expanse in front of you. It's *awe-inspiring*. It fills you with *wonder*. It makes you realise that there are much greater forces at work beyond your tiny little self. The realities of bill paying and mundane chores are a world away. You look out at the horizon and start to think big and dream and hope. You suddenly have a sense of perspective, understanding, faith, belief in something greater, something higher, something *more*\- this is Jupiter. It is epic in scale, legendary, mythic, beyond words. It fills you up and carries you on a high, makes you soar on optimism and a fascination for what's out there, waiting to be uncovered and explored. It makes you seek out and discover, it gives you meaning and purpose in life, it's your compass. This is why it's the Greater Benefic. It rules priests and sages and gurus and philosophers and scholars. Those who dispense advice and spiritual wisdom. Those who journey to find the truth and then teach and preach it to those willing to learn. And Jupiter does have the potential to shower you with knowledge, wonder, and blessings. Astronomically it's the Great Protector, its gravity pulling in comets that would otherwise smash into the Earth and slinging them away into deep space. 

HOWEVER Jupiter can also become self-righteous, self aggrandising and self-mythologising. Like the Sun it can have an inflated sense of self importance, which with Jupiter can veer into ""I'm divinely chosen, my beliefs are the *right* beliefs, and I'm meant to do something great, it's my calling."" Jupiter can become a zealot. Jupiter can also be too abstract and theoretical and ungrounded, not at all rooted in reality. The professor who lectures from their ivory tower, who promises a lot with big dreams and grand visions but doesn't always deliver. Jupiter can leave you disappointed and disillusioned, the expectations you had about your life lying in pieces all around you. You'll see all these themes (the good and the bad) in the two signs it rules- Sagittarius and Pisces. You'll also see in them Jupiter's indulgence- its indulgence in experiences, alcohol, drugs, food, TV- whatever your vice is, Jupiter (when unhealthy) will want more of it. The expansiveness of Jupiter becomes untameable and unmanageable and can spiral into addiction.  

I wrote a bit of an essay there but I love writing about Jupiter. I feel I can speak to its nature with some authority because I have it conjunct my Ascendant and aspecting other vital planets in my chart. But I feel it's important for all of us to access our Jupiter and find that greater sense of purpose and vision in our lives.

1651,"RELATIONSHIP ASTROLOGY: SYNASTRY, COMPOSITE &amp; ELECTIONAL this is a [follow-up to our post on compatibility &amp; astrology](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-mvmlPhNYb/). today, let’s chat about the three main methods to assess compatibility: synastry, composite charts, &amp; electional charts.

let’s start with synastry, as it’s probably the most popular method in Western astrology atm. synastry, or chart comparison, is a tool to assess the interaction between the birth charts of two people. it’s represented by an inner &amp; outer circle to represent each individual. 

synastry is helpful for comparing how individual characteristics impact relationship dynamics. it can illuminate strengths &amp; weaknesses, or places of ease &amp; tension. 

the key thing to remember about synastry is it’s about how energies influence on another: is there magnetic attraction (Mars)? are you emotionally in tune (Moon)? do you have similar communication styles (Mercury)? etc. 

a cool thing about synastry is that different charts will have different planets of focus, at different intensities. this reflects how different relationships have different purposes (e.g. platonic vs romantic) &amp; individuals have differing values (e.g. communication vs sexual chemistry). 

composite charts, on the other hand, combine the two charts into one using the midpoints to represent the relationships as a unit. I’ve heard them best described as the way in which a “relationship takes on a life of its own.” what is the output of these two parts combined? 

imo composite charts allow us to focus more on the houses &amp; see how this merging influences different areas of life. in addition, you can see how transits impact the couple as a whole, rather than individually in synastry. 

one of the key components of astrology is “aspects”: which represent the geometrical or angular relationship between planets. 

synastry observes the aspects between charts, while composite charts review the aspects within the chart.

there is also some merit of looking at the charts of milestone dates (first meeting, when relationship was initiated, marriage, etc.) - a branch of electional astrology. the principle here is that the timing of events has influence based on the arrangement of the cosmos. this is actually common practice in some cultures, where astrologers are consulted to help select the most “auspicious” aka favourable date to have a wedding. 

it’s important to state that relationship astrology is not only designed for romantic relationships: it can be used to assess any one-on-one relationship: parent, sibling, friend, boss, etc. I even heard of one astrologer who would draw up a synastry chart with their client prior to their first session together!

Consider a person born in a rich family of Manchester. In his home, he gets all type of facilities. He becomes a Mayor of London. So, in London, he would enjoy facilities as well as power/authority. Thus, he would fare better in London than Manchester. This is Exaltation.

Planets don't fare best in their own Signs but in some other Sign (Mercury being the only exception).

Some consider Rahu (Dragon's Head) exalted in Taurus, some in Gemini. Same way, people differ on exaltation Sign of Ketu (Dragon's Tail). So they appear twice in image.

In whichever Sign a Planet is Exalted, it gets Debilitated in 7th Sign from it, on the same degree. Debilitation Sign is opposite to Exaltation Sign. Start counting from Exaltation Sign!

The 12 signs of the Zodiac relate to different parts of the Human Body and also denote the diseases related to the respective paths. The signs should be considered along with the planets when we try to find out the potential disease a native can have based on their chart.

Other defects of the affliction of the sign are feverish disorders, eruptions on the face, accidents from fire related injury and cuts, as the sign is ruled by Mars. It might cause harelip, ringworm and apoplexy.

**TAURUS:-** If afflicted, it gives rise to complaints of throat and heart as diphtheria, goiter, laryngitis and by reflex actions may give rise to piles and fistula .Another problem caused by afflicted Taurus is apoplexy.

**GEMINI:-** Afflicted Gemini causes windy disorders, infirmities of the arms, hands and shoulders.

The lungs and nervous system are the chief parts that are affected.

So it is well known that the rising sign influences how new people see you, but I am wondering if it also influences how you perceive new people? For example how friendly (as enjoying the socializing, not talking about being a nice person) a person is in a work environment with people who are not close to him, etc.

What made me think about it is that I know a taurus sun woman with whom I worked, and she is really really friendly to anyone. She has this strong friendly vibe. I am taurus sun as well, however scorpio rising and people see me probably as intense and don't approach me much, which is kinda fine by me, I don't care much for socializing if I don't really like someone. But I believe that this woman REALLY enjoys the friendliness that she is sending out. I think that people see her so friendly because she really enjoys the socializing with many people. Btw I don't know her rising sign.

So I wonder, can the rising dictate as well how one may experience the socializing with people kinda foreign to him?",26,15,2020-04-10 05:01:25,astrology

1677,"Question to all about predictions This has been on my mind for some weeks now, if this may sound  rude please accept my apologies, it’s not my intention. English is not my first language, but I try my best to be as polite as I could, I’m only requesting for you guys to share your knowledge and your opinion. 

I have been reading quite a bit about Astrology. Incredibly fascinating, I’m just not sure my mind is smart enough to handle it. 

I’ve also been listening to quite a few on YouTube, with their predictions, and many are dire in their warnings and that the world would never be the same again, and there won’t be any stability until around the middle of the decade or even before it ends. Come this September it will be worst than this horrible thing we are all going through etc. 

I’ve seen many doom and gloom predictions before, is this time any different? In your experience and in your interpretation are these predictions anything special in the sea of previous earth shattering predictions that came before? Are these conjunctions so unique and when they happen it’s always terrible?

I really do respect what you guys know here. I’m actually concerned because I have a young family. 

I’d like to know from all of you, in your opinion, will life go on and be good after this terrible nightmare and we can all go back to some sense of normalcy or it really does go all downhill from now on? From what you’ve been personally reading and interpreting, regardless of the predictions some say on YouTube. 

I’ve seen it mentioned that the astrology charts we have now are akin to what they had when the plague started, or ww1 or the beginnings of ww2 or other catastrophic timelines in our history. 

Is this correct? Have these alignments ever happened before? Has there been benign results? Or when these conjunctions happen, it’s always globally catastrophic? Would you kindly expound on this?

Thank you all and be well and safe.",3,1,2020-04-10 11:16:10,astrology
1678,"This is how to like to think of and explain the big 3 (Sun, Moon, Ascendant) . 
I want to emphasize this isn’t all my original thought. With astrology, it’s pretty impossible to not integrate the works and studies of others into  your interpretations and explanations and general understanding.
The inspiration for explaining the big 3 in this way comes from “The Only Astrology Book You’ll Ever Need”. In this book, Joanna Woolfolk explains the sun sign like a the broad strokes of painting (which I mention below). I really loved this analogy, and then found ways to apply that thought structure to the moon and ascendant- but also just with astrology in general. It has allowed me to be able to hold a deep yet simple enough understanding to explain astrology to others. My friends and partners always ask me about astrology, and after getting insecure and frustrated with not being able to explain certain concepts.. I (used parts of other people’s work) to come up with this. 


EXPLANATION:

The ascendant will highlight certain aspects of your personality.. some you aren’t even aware of. 
A book I read (The Only Astrology Book You’ll Ever Need) put it this way-
If you consider yourself a painting,  the characteristics of your sun sign are the broad strokes that the artist first lays down in the canvas. The artist outlines your general shape, the planes and angles of your face, the way in which you hold your body.  In the same way - your sun sign delineates your general character. 
The moon in your horoscope modifies your sun sign; it brings new forces, different motivations, and special elements to the character of your sun sign ( I like to add this to the painting example, I think the moon would be the shadows and highlights of the picture, still black and white, filling in some of the empty spaces, giving you a deeper understanding of the character that is being drawn). These can often be the more hidden aspects of the personality. Your knee jerk reactions, instincts, the pieces of yourself you repress from others- even yourself. 
Your ascendant (rising) is the sign that reflects your outward demeanor, and to s great extent determines how the outside world looks at you. Very often, your ascendant is what the world first sees in you, the impression that you first make to other people. Many astrologers believe that your rising sign is more immediately revealing than your sun sign. 
I like to think that the personality you outwardly project is almost always a perfect blend of your sun sign and rising sign. It is this combination that makes your unique impact on the world. 

(I also like to add this to the painting example.. if you think about it, when you are looking at a finished painting of a character, your interpreting the final product. You’re  looking at the colors, the emotion in the eyes, the shape of the lips, the overall vibe the artist intended to give off (rising).You aren’t really seeing the broad strokes and the outline the artist first laid down to create this image (sun) but you instinctually know that these concepts are there, and these big shapes make up the image. You certainly aren’t seeing the shadows and angles and highlights that were there (moon) to tie everything in. You are really just seeing the “mask”, the final product.. what the artist wanted you to see (rising). As you get to know the painting more, as you sit with it, It hangs in your living room you will notice more and more about it and different aspects will be uncovered (like the whole birth chart).",26,138,2020-04-09 07:20:04,astrology

I read a random post yesterday, I'm not sure if it's true or not, that Trump signed some kind of executive order to allow the US to mine the moon. Let's say in a hundred  (or even two hundred) years or so, after bombarding and mining the moon for every bit of its resources, it is now a shell of its former self. Hypothetically, let's say, it literally now looks like a giant ball of swiss cheese. 

My questions: Would this affect astrology for future humans?  Since the moon is supposed to govern the emotional side of people in astrology...will future people born under this new swiss cheese moon also have holes in their emotional personalities? Would this also parallel the possibility of humans merging with AI one day in the future?

""Predicting death is not part of my repertoire. Even if it looks inevitable, it probably isn’t. Death surprises us and it looks different from person to person. It’s only a function of the 8th house in that it’s an end. The 8th house shows how we end things. Death is the ultimate  transformation. You can look to the 8th and 4th for themes but it’s almost impossible to predict when it happens. I would never try and neither should any  other astrologer.""

For example, I use the campanus system which gives me Uranus in the 7th house which fits me just fine and all. But it came to my attention that a lot of people use the whole sign system which I dont really like but I looked up my chart while using it for the first time and it gave me Uranus in the 8th. I know nothing in astrology is a guarantee but like, I thought I would be the last person to get in a freak accident, get struck by lightning, *anything* like that. Basically it can indicate a sudden and highly unusual death, but like most 8th house placements its more likely to just apply to regular boring things like money. I can be incredibly paranoid so that made me nervous anyway! but like luckily that house system is otherwise not accurate for me. Campanus is perfect for me. 

I have some peculiar 6th house placements which are a bit unsettling for me, a hypochondriac. of course I would be I have chiron in 6th and virgo in 1st. but anyway, I also have neptune in the 6th which can indicate an incredibly rare illness that is difficult to treat, but because neptune represents that which is hidden it is usually just an indication of mental illness or general disillusion with daily life. but still its not great for health and can give you something undiscovered or difficult to understand

1705,"Venus through the signs (fixed post) (: 1. Venus in Pisces (Exalted, love and perfection is present even when it isn’t, delusional)
2. Venus in Libra (Domicile, works best together to overcome problems and find unity)
3. Venus in Taurus (Domicile, likes to give gifts, live luxuriously, and naturally self-indulge)
4. Venus in Cancer (naturally gives nourishment and comfort without feeling demanded)
5. Venus in Leo (searches for a well-suited lover to embrace love and perfection, complimenting them)
6. Venus in Sagittarius (a freedom lover who lives for experiences and finding perfection and euphoria through adventure)
7. Venus in Gemini (is fun-focused and curious, finding perfection in knowledge and stimulation)
8. Venus in Aquarius (finds euphoria and perfection through the weirder parts of life / embracing the unorthodox and feeling unique)
9. Venus in Capricorn (perfection is achieved in *working towards* their expectations as the one in charge)
10. Venus in Scorpio (Detriment, prefers to stay away from giving trust, evolves by giving trust)
11. Venus in Aries (Detriment, competitive, independent, *enjoys conflict* in order to grow)
12. Venus in Virgo (Fall, perfection is always *worked towards* and sought in love through methodical work)

&amp;nbsp;

Here is a fixed version of my Venus in the signs post. 

&amp;nbsp;

The top of the list indicates perfection / euphoria / love that takes no effort, whereas the lower half instead prefers using Venus energy in a way of working toward perfection. According to much I’ve read, the more ideal Venus placements (like exaltation in Pisces / domicile in Libra and Taurus) come without working against the natural Venus way of just loving anyway.

&amp;nbsp;

For example, I find Pisces Venus quite interesting due to how far it can go with love, apparently believing love never begins or ends, more like love is always there. Even in relationships that are the opposite of love, the Venus in Pisces delusion will still think it’s all love. I find that interesting.

&amp;nbsp;

Venus in Virgo is described to be in its fall from what I’ve read, being that the placement views perfection as something most satisfying when worked for. It’s curious for me how the concept of Venus in Pisces is so unconditional and forever-lasting, whereas Venus in Virgo finds perfection after hard work for it. Thoughts?

1708,"SHAME THROUGH THE EYES OF PLUTO⁣ let’s talk about shame, shall we?⁣we often use the terms “guilt” &amp; “shame” interchangeably, but I feel it’s important we distinguish them:⁣  
⁣  
guilt is a feeling of responsibility or remorse for wrongdoing &amp; an awareness that our actions have injured/could harm another. ⁣  
⁣  
shame, on the other hand, is painful feelings that contribute to an internal schema of perpetual inadequacy, unworthiness, etc. ⁣  
⁣  
researcher Brené Brown says that “the difference between shame &amp; guilt is the difference between ‘I am bad’ &amp; ‘I did something bad.” ⁣  
⁣  
guilt is a useful response on a societal level, as the emotional distress that arises discourages future harmful behaviour. through guilt, we learn &amp; adapt, which strengthens us psychologically. shame is the absolute opposite: it harms our psyche.⁣ ⁣

unaddressed shame often leads to emotional disconnection &amp; isolation. our false beliefs reinforce suffering. Brown identifies that shame grows with secrecy, silence &amp; judgment. we can tackle shame by challenging our negative self-talk, being vulnerable, &amp; practicing empathy. ⁣  
⁣  
but how does this relate to Pluto? ⁣  
⁣  
Pluto is associated with power, polarization, compulsions, destruction, etc. where we find Pluto in the birth chart can illuminate where we experience shame. ⁣I’m no stranger to shame. I’ve got Pluto sitting directly on my Ascendant, therefore I need to address shame as related to my self-concept.  
⁣  
where does Pluto lie in your birth chart, and how do you experience shame in your life?

1713,"Jupiter and Saturn- Wisdom. Jupiter is the visionary/ the philosopher/ the pilgrim. 

Saturn is the architect/ the elder/ the authority. 

They are the two wisdom planets. Jupiter is the wisdom we seek out, that we journey to discover both out in the world and within ourselves. The more we experience the more we understand. It's the wisdom passed down to us from our gurus and mentors, who seek to inspire and enlighten us, to expand our vision and our horizons. Saturn is the wisdom we gain through life's hardships, disciplining us to mature, to take responsibility, to have dignity and respect for ourselves and our authorities. It’s the elder who’s failures and setbacks have made them a wealth of insight on the lessons they learned across a lifetime. 

Just some thoughts on two of my favourite planets. It’s also interesting to me that Jupiter has a clear resonance with water and fire (Cancer exaltation/Pisces rulership/Sagittarius rulership) whereas Saturn has resonance with air and earth (Libra exaltation/Aquarius rulership/Capricorn rulership).

1716,"Working With Difficult Aspects in your Chart I got this email from Astrolada this morning and found it quite interesting the way she plays around with planet archetypes and remediation. She illustrates them very simply, which I thought could be a great tool for anyone who finds aspects hard to interpret.

From her (my comments in italic parenthesis):

“This is the one topic in astrology I am most passionate about: remedies for difficult configurations in the horoscope!

What is the point of scaring a person about a difficult configuration they have and not giving them a solution? (*!!!! Ugh yes this*)

But here is how I use the natal chart to give the way out.

Say you have a very tight hard aspect between Mars and Venus, you might fight a lot with your partners, attract quarrelsome such, even be in danger of violence in relationships. You might spend money (Venus) impulsively (Mars), you might be more susceptible to kidney (Venus) infections and so on!

What is a remedy to this? I would look at any other planet sending an easy sextile or trine to Mars or Venus. Say Neptune sends a trine to your Mars.

Then you should consciously focus on doing and introducing Mars Neptune things to take off the tension from that Mars Venus square.

For example: swim (Neptune-liquids, Mars- exercise) or do yoga (Neptune-spiritual exercise -Mars) or dance (Mars) to music (Neptune) or do something (Mars) for charities (Neptune) or when fighting with a partner, and wanting to be mean, instead say a prayer (Neptune) to your self in the heat of the moment (Mars), or carry the icon of St George (saint=Neptune) killing the dragon (mars) ot another warrior saint and-pray to him for solving of your Mars Venus problems. 

(*I inadvertently do this! I have a scary Moon opposite Pluto, but Neptune trines my moon, and I keep an Archangel Michael pendant, bracelet or prayer on me at all times*)

If you happen to have a positive aspect to your hard aspect, you have a huge relief and you naturally incline to find more constructive solution in the planet with the saving aspect.

I can give you another very personal example.
I have Mars conjunct Venus in a tight opposition with Pluto. A classic combination for sexual attack, which happened once, a predator abducted me in a car when I was 17. But I have Neptune trine Venus and Mars and sextile Pluto and Moon also trine Venus and Mars and sextile Pluto. So two saving aspects to this aggressive combination, from two very gentle, calm and receptive planets.

What did I do to save myself? I became very kind and even loving, started asking caring questions and sympathizing with the kidnapper (Neptune, Moon) and was constantly praying (Neptune) in my mind too. I even started talking to him about God and love (Neptune) This immediately softened the attacker and he let me go. I am not saying this will work for everyone, but for people with gentle aspects from Neptune or Moon to aggressive planets, this will!

If I had Uranus trine instead, shocking the attacker by screaming and even jumping off the car would have worked better...

But what happens if you have no good aspect to a difficult configuration in your horoscope?

I guarantee you that at least one person of your immediate family or friends would have a planet making a Good aspect to your hard configuration. This person will be your saving grace!

 (*yes synastry is more than just are we compatible! It’s about having people in your life, no matter the relationship, who can fill in the problematic holes of your own. My mom’s Jupiter conjuncts my Moon and she is a person I always call for for support or a dose of wisdom*)

Having a Mars Saturn conjunction and you feel like strangling someone? But your Mom (dad, friend, husband) has a mercury trine to your conjunction. Then call her and talk it out (Mercury) with her, she will save you from many painful actions!

For example I have Mercury opposition Saturn. Not a single good aspect to this Mercury, no saving grace! Mercury rules my 5th: children. I find it highly difficult to deal with them on my own, within minutes I get overwhelmed and capitulate unable to make a decision or snap myself out.

But my Husband has his Saturn and Mercury trine mine! The moment he enters the room, I snap out of this stupor and can handle the children with more calm.

He becomes my voice (Mercury) of reason (Saturn). Me: “Mila is refusing her vegetables since a few days- she will never eat again vegetables and her immunity will go down and she will catch every Virus!” Followed by me feeling depressed (Saturn opposition mercury- negative self talk)

My husband: “Mila stopped eating vegetables a few times for weeks and then started again, she had just as strong immunity then. She will start eating again.”

Immediately my doom and gloom,
Saturn Mercury opposition gets soothed and corrected by my husband’s reason and reality check (Mercury, Saturn).

So find yourself someone who eases your hard aspects with their good ones and whenever the problem of the hard aspect manifests, go in the presence of or talk to that person. They will be your solution! :) “

It made me think, is it somewhere in one's birth chart what type of people/personalities/personality traits they would feel drawn to? Or is it actually more about how the character makes you feel, and the traits you find likeable are just coincidentally making you feel the same way? 


I feel like favorite characters are a bit different from one's favorite people. The people you surround yourself with often end up in your circle due to circumstances, meanwhile you choose favorite characters without any pressure.


I wanted to be able to connect my favorite character types to my birth chart but I'm not that good at astrology yet, I couldn't find a connection. I like characters who are accepting, friendly, direct - because they seem trustworthy and make you feel comfortable. But I also like characters who battle their own demons, who have issues and don't really know how to deal with them right - because I see myself in them.

For the majority of my life, I never really engaged with astrology beyond curious amusement (without any actual belief or conviction). There was always an underlying skepticism involved.

One day, I met a new colleague that I had this amazing, in-depth conversation with. At one point in the conversation, she paused and said “I’ve been talking to you for about two hours now, so I think I know you well enough to guess your sign.” She got both my sun sign and moon sign correct very first attempt.

1738,"Sagittarius Ive noticed wherever sagittarius is placed in a chart there is a lot of opportunity in that area of life. For example, the sign sagittarius is in my ic and my mother has given me so many opportunities even though I failed her more times than I can count. With a bad Jupiter placement I'd have maybe 9 chances before she gives up on me, but with a good Jupiter placement I could have 60 chances. I also know a person with the sign sagittarius in the second house. The amount of money they blow is insane, but it's like they have so many chances before they realize the proper route to take. All I see about sagittarius is how they're free spirited, philosophical, and like to learn a lot. People walk by my computer and they say why do u have so many tabs open, because I might need one of those routes to access more information.

Something told me to look up his chart and check his current transits. I saw that Uranus has just entered his eight house in last two weeks (it was announced he was positive 10 days ago). Anyone that knows about the themes of the eighth house know that unexpected death is one of the main themes as well as other people’s money, debt and the occult. From what I’ve read online, and what I know from people I know personally, people have experienced death of family members when this planet has been transitioning this house either in their chart or in chart of the person that has died.

I don’t wish death on anyone but seeing this has made me think is this something that is possible right now?

1747,"LUNAR NODES &amp; THE DISTORTED CONCEPT OF KARMA⁣   
the Lunar Nodes have vastly different meanings in astrology, depending on who you ask. in Vedic astrology, the Lunar Nodes are referred to as Rahu &amp; Ketu, the head &amp; tail of the snake.\* in Western astrology, they’re called the North &amp; South Nodes, and we often hear the terms destiny, fate &amp; karma thrown around to describe their meaning.⁣  
⁣  
but let’s get something straight. the use of the term “karma” in the Western world was appropriated from the East &amp; morphed by Judeo-Christian beliefs. ⁣  
⁣  
the Western interpretation of karma, in its essence, is an illustration of justice &amp; retribution: what goes around comes around. it’s an illustration of the Judeo-Christian ideology that our actions determine whether we end up in heaven or hell. the East teaches us that there is no final judgment. ⁣  
⁣  
in few words, the true definition of karma is “action,” and rewards or punishments are the result of karma, not karma itself.⁣  
⁣  
karma can be seen as the perpetual pattern of actions across lives, through reincarnation. over time, though, our actions tend to accumulate &amp; create tendencies, therefore we bear consequences for past actions in past lives. nevertheless, karma is the free will &amp; agency to either repeat patterns or break free from them. ⁣  
⁣  
this ties into our understanding of the Lunar Nodes as karmic patterns in Western astrology. from South to North. that which is innate to that which is acquired. the undeveloped to overdeveloped aspects of our character. familiar to unknown. stagnancy to expansion. self-undoing to self-actualization. ⁣

action is the only thing standing in our way. ⁣

how do you understand &amp; use the the Lunar Nodes in your practice?

1748,"Can we give Regulus some clout🌌 Regulus, king maker, and the archangel Raphael which rules fortune, success, courage, was in Leo for 2,000 years and I recently read when it first entered Leo, Julius Caesar was born, along with the grandparents of Jesus Christ. Around 2012, it moved into Virgo, and despite having profound effects I rarely see it talked about. To me, the effects of this transition are profound - we’re entering a time of feminine tranquility and acceptance. Although obviously not ecumenical in influence, many cultures all over the whole world (particularly western) are taking on the gentleness of Virgos feminine energy. Not to be totally liberal (which I’m not) LGBT people (like me lol) and women have flourished. Wether you think this is true or not, it’s undeniable millions of people are getting rights and acceptance which was unheard of for pretty much all of recorded history. Virgos tarot card is the Hermit, a highly respected card which represents deep wisdom. I’ve only been into astrology for a couple of months so sorry if some of what I say is inaccurate, but to me, Virgos are kind - they want to help people, they’re logical and practical and aren’t afraid to improve the world. I think most of humanity has felt Virgos gentle and virgin influence. Although you can argue a lot of our culture is very sexualized, I still think this reflects Virgos traits,  embracing the sexuality is embracing acceptance of everyone no matter their personal choices, and at least what I’ve seen is Virgos are actually pretty intense people when they open up. After all, Regulus is INCREDIBLY bright and powerful. I’d love anyone else’s opinions on this, especially anyone with planets conjunct Regulus and how they think it affects them!! I think Regulus moving into Virgo is beautiful for humanity, and as an amateur I’d love to hear others opinions on this :)",3,1,2020-04-07 12:06:27,astrology

1750,"this could be interesting, as the physical body, what signs possess what physical strength naturally? here’s my take on it, going based off of what body parts the signs rule as well as the constellation: 

aries &amp; taurus have strong muscles naturally, it can be easy for them to tone out their body.

gemini and virgo are fast

sagittarius can be fast as they rule the the thighs, but can have precise aim. (i play softball with a sag and she hits her target with a lot of force and precision) 

capricorns can have the strength of aries and taurus but also the agility.

Leo’s can be agile and have good reflexes.

aquarius and pisces can be fast, but those air and water elements can slow them down, they can use a lot of force if they use their strength in their feet and calves. 

now i’m not too sure about cancers and scorpios, i’d say cancers can be very strong like taurus, perhaps quicker than taurus though. scorpio’s can have a strong core, i think. abs can be easy for them.

libra can have balance (obviously) although, that might not always be in their favor. they might have a strong core as well. (if you think about it, you need a strong core if you’re constantly balancing things with both arms)",12,5,2020-04-07 00:55:37,astrology

(I'm not asking questions for anyone to interpret my chart, but on the general knowledge I can then apply to my chart and other readings. I'm merely using mine to illustrate examples.)

I know cusps are not a thing, but do planets being very close to borders between houses/signs affect them? If someone has a planet very close to the border between two houses does the influence of the planet trickle into the next house? Same for signs.

My Sun is in my second house, but only a few degrees away from the third house. (I use Placidus but some systems actually put my Sun in my third house) I can definitely see some parts of the third house being relevant to my Sun even though it's not technically in it with the system I'm using. My Uranus is also on 0 degrees and 27 minutes within Aquarius. Would the interpretation really be as cut and dry as if Uranus was a lot further in Aquarius?

- a protracted, controlling relationship with the mother (so far it's been much more accurate to interpret 'moon' as mother in my culture)

- emotions tending towards abnormal extremes
 
Among other things, but I want to focus on these two for now.  
 
I've covered 12 individuals with this aspect, only one of which (a tight conjunction) experienced an overly-controlling / obsessive mother, and some of which had maternal problems much better explained by a different moon aspect extant in the chart (eg. Moon 10th opp Neptune 4th for a social butterfly mom who severely neglected her daughter + her home).
 
Only 6 of them agreed to the second point about experiencing severe emotional extremes (coloured by the houses / aspects involved) and exhibiting controlling behaviour of their own. I suppose there's a degree of self-reporting bias involved here, but I've had exponentially better luck with many other unsavoury interpretations like Mars sq Saturn or Merc opp Neptune.

The theory is that when the moon is in your sun sign, you experience an energy peak, and when it's in your opposing sign, you experience a low.

Now I've always been a bit of a sceptic about the prediction part of astrology, but I always found these to be extremely accurate. I would forget about the diary for long periods, but a lot of the time when I would check it while feeling particularly lethargic, I would see I was in the lunar low. Conversely, during lunar highs, I was a lot more energetic and gregarious. My friends and family who were into astrology also found the same thing.

Today I feel like I've been hit by a truck. Super lethargic, physically and mentally. And for the first time in years, I checked the position of the moon. It enters Cancer today. But of course.

1865,"Wanted: Ephemeris in Excel The late, great astrologer Ed Tarabilda gave some clues on [this page](http://shell.forethought.net/~risaacs/n_us.htm) about a secret birth date for the USA. I'm trying to reverse engineer his work and to do that I need an ephemeris in Excel.

I have reverse engineered his work before. In that case I knew the year and I found the ephemeris for that year online. But now I'm looking at a huge date range - between 1750 and 1900.

If you have an ephemeris for those dates I would love to hear for you!",3,2,2020-04-01 15:01:35,astrology

1868,"Whatever changes coming in this year would be...permanent, right? Hi

I'm studying astrology with youtube, I still don't understand 99% of it, but keep hearing repetitive phrases that 'the change will be big, and will be permanent'.

I'm watching the way of our life is changing 180 degree right now, it's clearly possible that we'll never live in the way we used to be.

What's your insight? Do you think the world is gonna change for the better? Or worse? Would the society become more spiritual, open, transparent? Or will be totalitarian depressing future?",14,9,2020-04-01 01:25:36,astrology
1869,"Tell me about your chart and I'll describe a place for you This was inspired by that awesome person who made the FireMeUp post! It gave me the warm fuzzies to see how happy they made people :)

So when I think of astrology I think more about nature and places than people, since astrology is the influence nature has on us! Tell me your big three and any other interesting things about your chart, and I'll tell you what kind of place I see in my mind when I picture that.

Ex since I'm bad at explaining lol: One of my best friends is a Sag sun, Virgo moon, Capricorn rising with conjunct Scorpio venus and Libra mars in the 9H and this is what I came up with for her.

&gt;You are a forest of red pine trees with a field of smooth pebbles beneath the needles glimmering here and there in the late afternoon autumn sunlight, and next to the pines lies a cave. Deep inside the cave, on the cool, flat gray stone worn by time, a small campfire burns entirely on its own and illuminates cave paintings of stories made centuries ago. 

Thanks for sharing and letting me practice my astro/brainstorming skills!",108,37,2020-03-31 17:05:59,astrology
1870,"Night Sky Apps (The Moon) Maybe a dumb question ...

I've tried many ""Night Sky"" Apps, and many ""Moon Calendar"" Apps ...

* ""Night Sky"" are the Apps that let you aim your phone into the sky and see constellations
* ""Moon Calendar"" are the Apps that tell you what sign the moon is in

Something I've noticed: The Moon Calendars are never the same as the real moon in the sky.

For example, right now, the Moon is clearly in the sign of Gemini, if you use a ""Night Sky"" app, or simply look up into the sky. But, according to ""Moon Calendar"" apps, or even [this website](https://mooncalendar.astro-seek.com/), it says the Moon is in Cancer. 

Has anyone else noticed this discrepancy? - Looking into the sky, the Moon is never in the same sign as the ""Moon Calendars"" say it is - it's always one sign away ... Any good App suggestions? Thanks.",7,1,2020-04-01 12:48:05,astrology
