964,venus retrograde through the houses what you can expect tomorrow venus stations retrograde in gemini actually venus has been slowing down for a bit now called a station meaning her footprint is heavy in the sky likely you ve already been acquainted with the pitter pattering of themes you can expect during this period venus retrograde corresponds to general themes such as relationship reviews rewinds renewals and reversals evaluating how you relate to your own self worth and esteem retooling what you actually value need budgeting getting serious about finances hiccups with beauty related tools industries purchases and decisions but venus rx means more when you account for the house it will be drudging stuff up in my general take on venus rx is detouring into the ugly and resurfacing with a new appreciation of beauty kind of like the plot of shrek where are the ogres in your life and can you just decide to marry them and live happily ever after in a swamp with your donkey dragon friends i digress this rx will be decidedly less brutal than the one in scorpio those were some dire uggo times venus in gemini is peregrine and to me far more effervescent like a la croix some gross flavors but mostly ok the reviews and themes will have more to do with ideas thoughts beliefs etc very much juggling many dissonant thoughts and being okay with not settling on a conclusion this will be a mentally exhausting time for some gemini occupies a house in everyone s chart welcome to the circus first house a time to reconsider what makes you feel beautiful to redefine what beauty has to mean and look like a time of enhanced social awareness from a distance and learning how you bring a distinct value to people but first settling on how you wish to value yourself being comfortable with your many faces but also eliminating the faces the out grown personalities that do not suit you anymore second house a time to reevaluate how material possessions add beauty add value add ease or completely distract you from the assets that matter the most a renewed version of self care a hard and honest look at your bank account and closet and cabinets a purging to make room for new beautiful things to bloom divine dividends third house a time to reconsider what needs to be said holding space for new ideas to take the place of old ones learning to value your unique perspective whilst also respecting the perspectives of others work that neuro plasticity pave new grooves into your gray matter a time to stop and smell the roses as you are out and about rekindling bonds with siblings and teammates fourth house a time to spackle paint hang and rearrange where has the beauty in your home become stagnant and how can you insert new pathways of inspiration into your halls retooling your roots beautifying your sanctuaries finding aphrodite in your ancestry this can be a time to reacquaint yourself with the value a tribe a home a family and a foundation gives you that s how beauty can blossom fifth house a time to make friends with that blinking cursor on a blank page the dried paint brush the stack of half finished poetry in the corner of your room and the project that makes your heart sing but that you ve been too afraid to sing along with retool your relationship with your inner child that spark in the dark your authentic self could use some authenticating sixth house a time to throw out ugly habits dead end jobs and the futile and self deprecating sense of duty and responsibility you hold time for new rituals time put your worth and value ahead of the needs of others you are more than a cog in a machine you are the machine an extraordinary one and an extraordinary one needs all the tonics tinctures remedies and herbs beautiful insides make for a beautiful outside so celebrate your vitality and appreciate all that your body does in sickness and in health seventh house a time to throw out ugly people where are your relationships failing to live up to the happiness joy and wonder that you deserve time for the talks time to press send on an apology time to ask for help time to delete the dating profile and jump into the vulnerability of committed partnership or time to unwed yourself from the security of singledom and start to mingle your heart out also a good time to take inventory of the people you ve invited into your hopes and dreams the business affiliates that either help you sink or swim choose people who bring beauty and warmth into your life unbreak your heart time for new patterns eighth house a time to get a handle on your debt obligations on your portfolios and investments where are you over sharing where are you under sharing where can you give more and where can you divest immaterially your heart your humanness your deeply disowned ugliness they all deserve some tlc those ogres aren t so scary or ugly when you get to know them nothing to fear but fear itself a time for magic and mysticism to inform your path forward ninth house a time to reevaluate your schooling your education what you have accepting as truth actually has more to it become more nimble with your personal dogma and ideology challenges to your way of seeing the world don t have to be challenging but rather give you a wider array of intellectual and cultural beauty to sample from and enjoy though not a good time for travel certainly still a good time to plan that faraway corner of the world is calling out for you and that faraway corner of your mind could use a refresh where are your gurus and mentors failing to inspire you ditch the old paradigms there s a yellow brick road with your name on it tenth house a time to reevaluate your career your place in the world the value that you bring to the world and your unique set of talents where are you asking to be respected yet still bumping up against gatekeepers where can your creativity be better suited you are your own boss and your manager can t manage you time to step up into a firmer sense of self and confidence take up space be loud this is your world and we are living in it eleventh house a time to reevaluate your social networks your friend groups your hopes accomplishments and your communities at large unfriend the group think jettison the crusty cliques deactivate the profiles consider where society has perhaps let you down and recommit to creating environments worthy of the cause that is you there is beauty to be shared humanity has cracks but that is where light enters be the light even if you need to go dark for now twelfth house a time to reconsider where you self sabotage where you isolate where you needlessly alienate yourself and others this can be a deeply creative time when you burrow in the right direction where unconscious gifts lay where spirituality sparkles where the undulations of life at large are within your grasp beautify your alone time make it work for you give your mental hardships some love and tenderness play around with the unknown remold your trauma and psychic entanglements find the beauty in necessary endings and loss for that is how you begin again x b mazel,153,412,2020-05-13 02:13:41,0,1273,2
965,the oversimplification of the sextile the following is a write up of a personal view of the sextile aspect through personal research and experimentation feel free to agree or disagree aspects have been an incredibly important staple in astrology since the study of the stars first began the twelve signs of the zodiac are always aspecting each other viewing or existing conversationally in one way or another planets become energized by these aspects of signs which can be more or less benefic trine and sextile malefic opposition and square or a powerhouse of a wild card depending on the combination of planets involved conjunction through the years of studying astrology i ve seen a great number of astrologers downplay the beauty of the sextile the conjunction the opposition the trine and the square are all payed adequate homage to yet the sextile is either lumped in as a simpler satellite to the trine downplayed as fundamentally weak in league with minor aspects or an aspect that shouldn t be examined at all unless its orb of influence is particularly tight i feel this is a great mistake for one the sextile is a major aspect according to the thema mundi it carries the nature of beautiful planet venus because venus ruled libra forms a sextile with sun ruled leo and we never ever downplay venus smitten with every good thing she affords us sextile signs are of different modalities but the same polarity like people from neighboring nations with different cultures coming together to achieve a common goal so incidentally the gifts granted by the sextile are not automatically available to you like they are with the trine and instead have to be discovered explored and cultivated in some ways i feel this can be more powerful than the trine the aspect lorded over by the greater benefic jupiter why because when blessings and talents are so readily given without being tempered by active cultivation it can dampen the motivation to work towards something with those gifts hence the trine being associated with laziness imagine if you will a person born into considerable wealth having never needed to work for said wealth yet benefiting from it as their birthright that would be akin to the trine the greater gift now picture a person born into a middle or lower class family but possessing gifts that have the potential to accrue substantial wealth for the native if they discover what those gifts are and work towards cultivating them and bringing them to light that is the sextile the lesser gift we tend to prefer the former but the latter has its place the sextile like the trine is a beneficial aspect but comes with its own energy and blessings not to be confused or combined with that of the trine i believe sextiles are more important than what they are currently given credit for and i feel that people should not gloss over their sextiles but study them and work out the buried gifts and talents that they are promising,4,20,2020-05-13 16:53:18,0,509,16

979,draconic astrology seems kind of invalid i m not trying to sound negative but based off what i ve heard the origin of draconic charts came from a misinterpretation of ancient texts a few decades ago despite this people are calling it the essence of the soul and whatnot i kind of don t get it aside from that it also takes north node in aries at degrees as the calculating point for what your draconic signs are which also makes no sense to me what makes the sign of aries the point and not say scorpio or whatever because it s the first sign even if it is i m not sure why everyone would have to start from it aren t the nodes supposed to be individual life points for everyone what makes the aries node the starting point of all souls anyway that s all for my rambling thoughts,11,29,2020-05-12 21:52:25,0,152,21

1058,natal scorpio energy and the downfall of hillary joe biden and the democrat establishment so i want to say that as someone who leans a bit too far left in politics the current state of the

politics more about astrology while any of us can look it up here is the natal chart for joe biden https astro charts com persons chart joe biden i cannot help but wonder that just like with hillary his downfall is going to be having such strong scorpio energy in his chart and there is a reason for that despite modern day astrologers albeit with a strong bias pointing to it as the strongest sign scorpios tend to struggle with direct confrontation especially if it is a mars in scorpio think of it this way a mars in scorpio is about control if you do not question it or challenge it then it can run things smoothly you do not question why it does what it does the mantra is do as i say no as i do as a boss or a parent a scorpio mars is phenomenal because it thrives in the positions of authority where nothing can be done to challenge it when it is on equal footing a scorpio heavy chart relies on behind the door tactics and means to get ahead it is different from a combative aries mars a scorpio mars is more hidden more subtle and more behind the scenes such is the modern day democrat establishment vote for us or you are a racist sexist bigot or insert insulting word here no objective reason to vote for us is highlighted just that how can you not for vote for us think of opposing a scorpio heavy energy as a gasp i mean how could you how could you say that abusive parents who told you that you were no good and a piece of crap are bad parents you are supposed to respect your parents no matter what how could you oppose our party you can t possibly like that racist sexist bigot and shallow being can you okay then support us don t question don t challenge and don t resist accept us and bow it s almost like a sense of entitlement mixed in with virtue signaling and moral self righteousness going unchallenged that lets such an energy thrive now i have nothing against scorpios given that i qualify for having a stellium in the sign and have a plutonian chart hence my breakdown but i guess i am not so out of touch to see weaknesses in the very energy i want to actually win against some candidates particularly the traditional republicans and the self righteous it could have worked against a paul ryan and the republicans willing to play by the rules it works a jeb bush or a ted cruz it works a traditional goody two shoe caring about their status it works such candidates are prone to being insecure about how moral nice or good they are as people such people in general are prone to falling victim to a scorpio mars because a scorpio energy preys on such people it relies on their need to be seen a certain way in order to control them please the boss play corporate politics and respect social norms hence why a scorpio mars is considered powerful it knows how to make you bend to your morality while toppling you and disrespecting you enter the donald while modern astrologers are hellbent on telling us all that scorpios are some unstoppable force i think a scorpio energy s true weakness is transparency and the lime light scorpios work behind closed doors and away from public sight they are the invisible hand now trump is a gemini with strong leo energy to him enter the kryptonite outside of capricorn i think that leos and the air signs are the kryptonite of scorpio energy and how so it s simple they make you go against them in the open now a bernie sanders type of energy that is maybe radical but transparent could fare quite well against trump because bernie stands for something the scorpio energy of biden is simply just trying to get the presidency no matter how much you have to bend your beliefs and values to do it yet gemini is communication it is the news media that exposes a celeb s dirty secrets you can only hide from it and cover up your trucks until it finds out leo well leo is domiciled by the sun and the sun is the self leo is the crazy friend you have who can somehow own up to being a crazy friend and make it look cool in other words what you see is what you get most of all a leo can own their personality to the masses they put them at ease now this is why obama was such a favorable candidate to the democrats it was due to his leo energy radiating a trust in the masses that scorpio energy cannot scorpio is control through whatever means even if and usually dishonest and totalitarian now how does leo defeat scorpio while gemini lifts up the skirt of a scorpio and shows its hypocrisy a leo easily outshines and wins people over leos are your favorite teacher while scorpios are the teachers that scared you into liking them angered enough a leo will easily use their charisma and strong tone to point out the flaws in a scorpio everyone saw but was too scared to point out why it is even worse in this age we live in an age of transparency and communication which was not always the case back in the day when elections could be rigged without media attention now candidates have to answer for past gaffes and past mistakes even moreso as the age of aquarius approaches this will get even worse you cannot hide now i think that by picking more honest and open candidates who can own up to their personality and foolish flaws democrats can win the white house in the future i do not think hillary or joe are those candidates,61,67,2020-05-09 10:42:26,0,1071,10

1088,astrology for the state of georgia what if attitudes of the collective in an area can be shown by its potential chart as you all may be aware the state of georgia is in the news again for the wrong reasons surprisingly its racism now i lived in the south for a good portion of my life and while racism is an issue moreso down there compared to other areas of the country i always got the feeling that something about georgia was maybe different i think something about all of the states is different but i thought to myself what if we did a natal chart for the states and then evaluated a bit well it was tricky as heck while as a colony georgia was founded on february it was recognized as a state in the info listed below now research tells me that georgia was founded on january initially the best i could do was find this source which says that georgia is a capricorn sun with a scorpio moon see below http wisdom magazine com article aspx no matter what georgia cities you look at tons of capricorn energy initially i tried doing a natal chart for georgia but it was very very tough the reason is i do not have the exact birth time of the state which means the rising and midheaven signs would be off along with other signs the one i did do had a mars in cancer and aquarius venus but we are going to leave that out for now even with the capricorn sun and scorpio moon i ended up realizing just how georgia was different from other southern states i was in and how it reflected on the overall population i knew there digging down into my experience in georgia before georgia i had lived in various southern states and it was different people were nice and they were very down to earth it was almost a genuine type of niceness in those places the one trend i always saw in georgia whether i was in athens or atlanta the constant need to climb the social ladder and be popular i noticed how appearances perception and how the world saw you mattered more to the people in georgia than other southern states i was in you were only wanted company if you helped others get ahead whether it was the music and film scene in atlanta or the church appearances scene in the suburbs it was all about how do you help me get ahead social politics were cut throat and everyone wanted to get ahead it was all about the outward success of some kind whether it was the trophy wife popularity status or fancy house tying it into capricorn people might initially say that it is actually a very leo thing to want all that well i find that leos are not as materialistic as capricorns they are more so driven by a need to prove something to themselves and the world a capricorn values getting ahead without much regard for the feelings of others different from leos who actually do take that into account because they care more about how they are seen and perceived based on things other than just their material success to a capricorn it is always about appearances but different from how it is for a leo a leo sees themselves as a gladiator that want the battle the world cheers for the victor and throws rewards at them a capricorn sees success differently it s about being the victor no matter what the world thinks you climb to the top then who cares if they like you or not you re a the top let the other things about you hide just get your success plus capricorn is associated with the planets of saturn and exalted in the sign of mars the scorpio moon the moon is in an unfavorable position in scorpio the reason i find is because scorpio moons tend to hide their feelings and show a tough exterior time and time again i see this with scorpios in general the need to be perceived as powerful while really just hiding the inner weaknesses that might be there now i saw this play out in georgia with materialism that heavy desire for fame among the locals more so than other parts of the south and even america and the need to play high school popularity games well after high school you almost felt like there was a tight social leash in georgia you couldn t cuss without someone seeing it as a social sin and everyone was walking around social eggshells in a way such is the scorpio moon coming out that need to control what others say and do so you can have power over them meanwhile do your damage behind the scenes and try to challenge the moral character of other people social trend and the future a recent murder of a black man went unnoticed and it was only after a video was shown was something done about it again it wasn t done because of care it was done because it could ruin the reputation of an entire area even more especially given the supposed social strides its city atlanta made as being so progressive and a mecca for black america i think that as georgia becomes more influential as a state and atlanta grows as a city especially given how big film culture is there we will see it we will see if the area is one of substance or a plastic city with fancy buildings and events compared to a city like new orleans austin or nyc which have character,26,10,2020-05-08 11:57:50,0,957,11

1131,new cycle alert south node sagittarius north node gemini and what it means for you extra extra read all about it that s the energy of gemini nn to me haha on a societal level sn in sagittarius end of my way or highway soap boxing end of dogmatic thinking being accepted as truth the illusion of fake news lifting losses to the way we travel globally less my way or the high way nn in gemini fact over philosophy and theorizing able to hold many ideas at once expanding on the ability to change your mind common sense letting new information in in general sn sag is the archetype of a well traveled and knowledgeable sage in whatever field seeking to share what they know this archetype appears to know it all about everything and will make sure you know that the plus side is what this placement does indeed have a lot to share the downside is that they don t listen to other people factor in the details and have a hard time separating their ego from their smarts marco polos nn gemini is seeking to be that better listener to siphon through all the relevant details and facts to be comfortable learning from others this placement is community oriented and less about traveling far and wide time to be in the present moment here and now what matters this second on a personal level it depends a lot on what houses sag and gemini are for you and if there are planets there my basic approach sn drain nn gain so wherever the nn is where we can experience gains and wherever the sn is where we can experience drains here are some ideas to get you thinking aries asc gains in the third house drains in the ninth a period of community oriented endeavors of letting new ideas permeate your daily life less lusting after faraway places and lofty mindsets but letting the here and now spark wonder taurus asc gains in the second drains in the eighth personal income from your own personal endeavors make right with what you owe people and get your head around your debt retooling your beliefs around money and possession gemini asc gains in the first house drains in the seventh a period of coming into your own without seeing other people as a necessity in that journey speaking up for yourself face forward now retooling which relationships are needed and which you can jettison cancer asc gains in the twelfth drains in the sixth the daily habits or jobs that once sustained you are becoming beige boring or broken looking towards the metaphysical to bring back a sense of magic and wonder and letting that seep into your routines leo asc gains in the eleventh drains in the fifth less about what personally makes you feel good and more about what you can bring to the community to make them feel good creation needs an audience be it a piece of work art a child or yourself you may make lifelong friends and associates time to find your tribe mingle virgo asc gains in the tenth drains in the fourth volume is turned up on your place on the world stage opportunities to bolster your sense of purpose will be abound you may have to say goodbye to staying small or staying hidden and bloom past what your family expects of you an end of the comfort zone libra asc gains in the ninth drains in the third a period of travel whether journeys of the mind or journeys in real life commit knowing all there is to know and seeing all there is to see and practicing all there is to practice this will expand your horizons true wisdom requires time and a nimble mind spiritual passages await scorpio asc gains in the eighth house drains in the second your sense of personal insecurity will be made up for by the graciousness of others a period of true sharing investment and resourceful intimacy the ways that you waste money or valuables your time and energy and patience too will become apparent and asking for help from others is your best bet sag asc gains in the seventh house drains in the first a period of relationships that can help you reevaluate who you are and where you re going not the loss of self sufficiency per se but the ability to let others co pilot this stretch cap asc gains in the sixth drains in the twelfth time to be more real world oriented the isolation that serves you the spiritual practices that unnerve you these are to keep and help you become better in life on the job and for others all the other psychic chatter alienation trauma sabotage that does not bolster you must go break down to build up not to stay broken this opens up new ways to be of service to remain flexible in your duties and to remain childlike and light as you approach each day aqua asc gains in the fifth drains in the eleventh social exhaust extraneous friends arsenals of acquaintances groups and beliefs you have grown out of time to spring clean your social networks a true sense of belonging comes from authenticity of self and all else that spring from that opportunities for pleasure joy art creation romance and love remind you who you are and who is worth keeping around your own best friend pisces asc gains in the fourth drains in the tenth a place for solid roots a home a family these are all themes that are of concern it is less important that you be respected by the world by your colleagues than it is that you have a place to relax and retreat to feel safe and secure to delight in the smaller successes of comfort a family dinner a mortgage in your name and a place to lay your head you step down from an authority figure and are content to just feel content your mom your dad your home note that the drain gain paradigm isn t black and white there won t be complete losses in one area so don t expect that rather a clearing up drain allows for the gains to have space to settle in for example gemini rising draining of relationships that don t serve gives gemini rising the space to come into their own doesn t mean all relationships are doomed the sn and nn work in tangent no need to completely ignore or abhor or fear one in service of the other the sn is the launching pad the nn is where we go once launched also remember that the sag gem axis is one that is inherently cerebral in nature it deals a lot with the mind so gemini information gather versus sag i know it all is what is fundamentally at play here at the end of this period you will know more about what there is for you to learn i e these changes could for some play out entirely in your brain,119,308,2020-05-06 00:52:06,0,1193,0

1151,easily explaining the difference in what sign a planet is in versus what house a planet is in versus your placidus lines up which house each sign is in starting with your ascendant disclaimer i am not an expert this is simply my way of trying to make sense of all this based on my experience and my circle of influence and individuals charts i ve been able to look at and evaluate so my theory or thought on the matter is as follows placidus outlines someone s value structure and is one of the more predictive astrological tools because it sort of characterizes your houses with the energy of the sign that lies within example scorpio is the sign of transformation scorpio in the nd house nd house deals with wealth and possessions therefore someone would predict a major shift or transformation dealing with that individuals wealth or possessions simple enough crazy enough i ve found a lot of predictive aspects of the placidus to line up okay now the house a planet is in in my experience the house a planet is in indicates the way a person thinks of that part of life and that part of their personality ask someone to describe themselves they will most likely describe from the point of view the house the planet is in example i m virgo sun but my sun is in the th house i ve always felt the need to rebel and to look out for the people at a disadvantage i still think in this way despite knowing that lines up more with the th house which is the house aligned with aquarius importance of this being how someone will see themselves versus how they are seen lastly and most prevalent the sign a planet is in is the true characterization of the individual so as the house tells what lies beneath the sign a planet is in tells you how that part of you truly manifests in the world the importance of this being it may be the hardest pill to swallow we inherently do not see ourselves clearly therefore connecting with the true energy of the sign a planet lies in is very difficult but will inevitably allow us to realize the full potential of that part of ourselves okay that was long but tell me what you think and your thought process behind the importance of these major aspects of your chart,4,4,2020-05-06 02:28:53,0,409,2

1170,the moon and birth order age of mother so i love astrology and i like to pair it with psychology as well as search for patterns one of the most interesting predictive aspects in a chart is the moon and how it predicts your relationship with your mother so i have personally noticed a pattern between moon signs and birth order or mother s age sort of a chicken or the egg thing is it the environment youre inevitably born in that dictates how you act out your moon or why your moon placement was what it was or is it your moon placements immediate effect on your disposition and your emotions that dictate the relationship between you and your mother which then shapes how you express yourself emotionally personally i think a little of both but more of the latter i think i have found a cohesive pattern with some outliers obviously but i would love to hear if you guys have noticed a correlation or specific patterns in moon signs birth order or age maturity of the mother,120,19,2020-05-05 03:49:35,0,180,3

1206,does pluto represent transformation one of the top buzzwords associated with pluto is transformation i ve also heard similar terms like regeneration or resurrection all of which represent the idea of metamorphosis or personal evolution much of the symbolism that has been attached to pluto is due to the abc system aka the idea that pluto scorpio the th house imo using these three components of astrology planets signs houses meshing them into one has really diluted our understanding of their individual significations in this case the concept of scorpio transformation were inherently attributed to pluto i think some modern astrology has tried to paint pluto in a more positive light i associate pluto with crises power destruction death as well as the deepest darkest parts of our psyche our compulsions our manipulative tendencies dichotomized thinking these definitions are all different iterations of trauma but trauma doesn t inherently equal transformation it s an important distinction as i believe pluto represents the crises that can destroy us or force us to regenerate if we assume personal growth healing are an inevitable outcome of pluto it discounts the conscious ever consuming effort one takes to transform the self in addition it disregards the fact that not everyone has the resources to aid mental physical or spiritual healing access to time off work therapy spiritual guides etc are a privilege that aren t available to all many individuals live in survival mode pluto being emblematic of transformation undermines the concept of autonomy disregards our role in how our birth chart manifests we are all capable of growth but we must acknowledge that our birth chart is both a illustration of our highest potential a map of the forces that exist outside of our control pluto is our power to change but pluto is also the societal powers that bind oppress us,4,8,2020-05-03 05:32:37,0,309,5
1207,another way of conceptualizing natal chart interpretations personifying the planets and the placements what does mercury s house look like literally his actual house it s probably full of different tools of from different fields like various scientific equipment books on different subjects writing utensils scholarly articles maybe there s a telephone on the wall a tv flipping channels access to the internet it s full of potential pathways of interest mercury likes to keep busy and stay informed and experiment with new knowledge so these are the things he fills he house with if mercury s house rd house is under the sign of the capricorn constellation maybe the house is surrounded by high mountains right at sunrise inspiring accomplishment and aspirations the structure of the mountains are reminiscent of tradition and order and their ancient age reminds us of our karmic fates this is the atmosphere that the rd house is residing in here and who s here visiting mercury s house rd house under the capricorn stars in capricorn why mars is passing through how does forceful and powerful mars interact with the objects in mercury s house how is he influenced by the environment of capricorn he sees the tools of interest and education laying around and the stars fill him with an energy to make something out of it all and with mar s red pulsing energy he is driven to do a lot with the tools here in the rd house sure he might get a little frustrated and tear the place up but with the right help from his neighbors he may very well be able to build something great with the tools mercury left i ve been struggling with understanding how the planets constellations and houses exert their energy in their unique ways on the native when i started thinking of the planets as actual beings with desires personality traits and a will of their own it helped me a lot maybe it can help you too think about what each planet might be like if they were personified what would their houses dwellings be like what would their home constellation look like as a natural environment now put more than one planet in a specific house how do they interact with each other in that environment and then to think about the aspects neptune can see moon across the way waving at him they are at a harmonious angle so the moon is always sending neptune smiles and good vibes from her house across the chart they are at a good angle to each other but pluto he sees the sun over there around the block he hates that guy he s always sending dirty looks around the corner how do their energies clash at that hard angle,11,140,2020-05-02 10:45:13,0,467,10

1299,rd house i saw someone post this about the th house and having a rd house stellium of planets here myself i figured i d pose the question to see if anyone else has this type of placement or meaningful placements to them and or what it means for you personally i ve seen varied significations for this house these range from the following siblings and other distant family communication mind or perception introductory coursework or general studies jack of all trades driving neighbors being a heretic or having a voice i can see why it relates to heresy being opposite the th house of temples churches i guess i ll comment on that my moon is here and i believe that our own body is our own sanctuary temple so i do not feel that it is necessary to go to churches or temples or mosques to pray i ve also spent a large part of my life challenging organized religion to begin with though i do understand how it is beneficial for some people i certainly don t consider myself an atheist but very spiritual i also see a big difference between using placidus and whole sign when it comes to this house maybe moreso than in other houses one of the main reasons i use placidus in addition to whole signs is because my natal mars makes more sense being here its h in whole sign because i am very argumentative about my points and i process information better when i m moving i also have uranus in this house so my points tend to be eccentric to begin with but neptune here usually softens both and helps me communicate poetically but i tend to get lost easily i feel like whole sign is better for more objective analysis ex saturn in rd may mean no siblings please don t take this post to be a question about myself i just want to know what the rd house means for you and how it may potentially manifest in your life if you have placements there thanks,32,5,2020-04-29 07:01:56,0,349,7

1313,pluto retrograde a sign of the times so pluto stationed for retrograde and i can t help but notice how profound the message coming through is here we have pluto reaching almost the end of capricorn and it feels like we re all rushing with relief to move on to the aquarian waters and be done with this intense saturnian inquisition i see this reflected so well in how the states and world are planning some literally on the same day of the station to open back up again i see the protests indicating that we re ready to be done we can feel it how close it is to transition into something new only now we regress and step backwards into it all again but we re gonna be in deep hard intense denial about that as we continue to try to move forward even as all the other planets follow suit and it really hits home can t help but see how much we re going to need to learn some major lessons in the coming months before the autumn brings us back into forward momentum again more and more the idea of this being the big shift forward into the aquarian age seems quite apt and those equalizing ideals have little room for privatized interests and narcissistic manipulations it seems the deep pluto cap restructuring is beginning the stage has been set this week s anne ortelee podcast was pretty good and overall seems like a great time to take inventory of what needs to happen to get through these coming backwards and forwards stages with the least amount of complication and obfuscation,1,14,2020-04-28 12:56:15,0,276,12

1327,the astrology of the atlanta child murders ft wayne williams hbo is running a great docu series on this case right now it was also the main plot point on the nd season of netflix s mindhunter basically from to black children adolescents and youngish adults were killed in atlanta wayne williams was is the alleged murderer but they only got him on the deaths of the older victims so essentially there are unsolved child murders did wayne do it did he not i think he did speculatively sadly the living relatives of these children are in continual anguish as williams was never tried for their murders no one was so what is the astrology behind it all specifically wayne williams to start williams was very aware that he was a gemini he was an amateur music executive manager person and had a band called gemini he was known to kind of lovingly lament that he had two sides i am presenting here that yes he did have two sides and with a virgo asc and moon probably an infinite amount of sides dude was very mercurial dude was very mutable his birth chart is rated a look up a picture of wayne williams that s a textbook virgo rising bookish and nerdy looking unassuming always in a collared shirt and slacks his virgo affect would put many off to his ability to commit heinous acts he was simply too geeky to pull it off they assumed to hear williams talk you can suss the virgo out too very well spoken he had a very ardent interest in broadcasting and journalism he had a police radio in his car so he could hear about crimes immediately after they happened and then he would rush off to take pictures and be the first one on the scene he became somewhat of a rookie investigator and police and broadcast personnel knew him well later he would even rush to the scenes of crimes that he allegedly committed williams had his sun in gemini placed in his th conjunct his mc he also had his nn conjunct neptune in the rd house in scorpio he was positioned not only to seek recognition from his community news gathering gemini but the rd house scorpio also rendered those happenings sordid in nature rushing to the scenes of fires of murders of accidents etc there was something uniquely dark about the information he sought to disseminate with a strong th house sun and neptune right on top of his soul desire williams delusionally went after fame in his community neptune is a glamour making agent and there is nothing more glamorous than being recognized than being made authority over something only clearly williams went after it in less than realistic and downright insane ways that police radio didn t stop there williams paraded around in his car and often pretended to be a cop some say to lure his victims in rx saturn in fall in sagittarius in the th his sense of authority trine pluto in leo in the th an immense personal will a sense of purpose but perverted and stunted in addition to his sleuthing williams was fond of music he owned a radio station his mercury was in beauty and music loving taurus and exactly trined his asc sweet talker able to convince he handed out fliers to young children with artistic promise saying that he could turn them into the next michael jackson that s a high return on investment maybe even delusional you d say oh neptune opposite venus in aries out of sign but also venus opposite jupiter in libra venus ruling over that taurus mercury in fall in aries opposite dreamy neptune and boastful jupiter dude had a massively inflated ego and wildly unrealistic expectations in the th house that venus got him in trouble venus struggles in aries and even moreso in the th wayne williams was allegedly a closeted gay man most of the murder victims were young boys so also a pedophile here is the most perverted manifestation of venus hiding out in debility in a house associated with trauma death mystery and deep deep deep privacy was williams ravaged by his own disowned desires venus in a mars sign can have a violent loving nature at the very very worst so this placement sows the seeds of a twisted and knotty psychological pathology around relationships why children though i d guess that its all the mercury emphasis in his chart specifically the gemini the archetype of peter pan forever young and curious innocent williams had mars in pisces in the th so we see now that he has all the mutable signs activated this means venus and mars have a mutual reception in his chart venus helped out mars from aries mars helped out venus from pisces they strengthened one another that music was a huge part of his predation is evident here that he was a predator at all is also evident here folks with mars in the th house have relationships that are well martial aggravation heat cutting severing separation volatile violence in the most basic way this may just be a person who suffers numerous break ups or has passionate affairs but in the most disturbing way this is a person who relates to others violently williams mars was opposite his moon and loosely opposite his ascendant that he could appear shy and bookish only to also descend into deep rage or violence is the opposition at play here moon in the first house folks his in virgo are also very talented at getting people to emotionally resonate with them and in virgo its very much the wouldn t hurt a fly temperament many of his friends and family opined that they never saw williams get angry or even annoyed moon in the st house renders one sensitive emotional soft and watery but for williams this was a convincing mask i wouldn t be surprised if his safe moon exterior is what led many kids to go off with him moon is mothering and many of his victims were street kids kind of lacking that warm and safe home environment moon opposite mars is one of my uh oh s for sussing out someone s capacity for violence or anger and williams has two more of my uh oh s saturn square moon and saturn square mars t square yall saturn with the moon is harsh it dampens emotions or restricts them completely to murder anyone you kind of need to turn off the empathy and saturn is that deadening agent the square also doesn t help as it becomes a source of unending tension that needs to find an outlet emanating from his th house i d also opine that something happened in his childhood in relation to his parents that may have made him snap it doesn t even have to be long endured abuse of any kind maybe an expectation or a passing comment that somehow led williams to overachieve in the worst way and to hide his sexual desires his parents were well respected but not much else is said about his childhood beyond that saturn square mars puts both malefics in a malefic conversation with one another this is an aspect of repressed anger it can also be an aspect of repressed sexuality as mars is the principle of sexual desire in men his in pisces another speculation could render his sexuality more fluid and thus we get repressed desires of a gay or bisexual man mars saturn people have a tremendous will to succeed at anything these people are formidable it was often said that williams could not have killed anyone because of his perceived lack of physical strength to this i say don t underestimate the strength of mars saturn people to this i also say if you are a murderer trying to dispose of a body no doubt you re going to summon up every last piece of strength you have to hide your trail much like the phenomenon of a protective mom being able to lift a car if her child is in danger williams also had a disproportionate amount of hate for the demographic of children killed young poor black boys it matters that they are also darker in complexion where williams is very much light yellow without admitting to anything he said they deserved to die because of their lifestyle that atlanta needed to be cleaned up of their type yikes mars in the other people house explains the hate saturn in the sector of home ancestry and roots explains why his virgo asc and moon also likely made him a perfectionist with ideas of what is perfect good how things should be etc etc this ends the long form narrative style of explanation now i just want to list out a few astrological coincidences most of the children were strangled in some way which i think is a manifestation of asc and sun ruler mercury being in taurus taurus rules the neck up close and personal killing using the sense of physical touch when he was arrested he was so obsessed with his own celebrity he held a press conference in his house was acutely aware of news cameras following him etc sun in the th conj mc and the manifestation of needing fame recognition his lawyers said he was very difficult to work with a more textbook manifestation of mars in the th people it is worth noting that his sun rules his th house in the end his ego put him in jail after he was incarcerated all of the killings stopped williams was arrested when transit mars was conj his sun and mc virgos can be methodical killers killing with a perceived sense of purpose a clear directive his moon had no kind aspects his emotional life and relationship to his mother were doomed from get go plus moon can behave coldly in virgo hashtag notallvirgos i know i know weirdly enough it was the virgo details that sealed his fate carpet fibers and dog hairs virgo rules small pets he was a liar he once passed out a resume saying that he was a pilot and a race car driver this is the virgo overachiever master of many type of archetype also that lying ass neptune in the rd house williams still proclaims his innocence and says the real perpetrators were the kkk and that atlanta pd and the fbi pinned everything on him to avoid a race war this has something to do with saturn down there in his th and his fantasy making neptune and jupiter aspects williams was convicted of murders under an interesting set of transits sun square his natal sun and mc forming a conj with his natal mars jupiter stationed rx in scorpio reversal of good fortune revealing misdeeds transit moon in aries conj natal venus transit neptune conj natal saturn and transit uranus opposite natal sun do with that what you will lastly williams had interesting synastry with the city of atlanta itself his sun was opposite the sag nn of atlanta his own personal desires and will were antithetical to the symbolic pursuits of atlanta in the documentary mention is made that these child murders really tarnished the reputation of what atlanta meant to black folks at the time as a place to rise up in society atlanta has a stellium in capricorn and was is a place of black wealth and prestige it also tarnished the reputation of atlanta s first black mayor whose tenure will forever be intermingled with the poor handling of these atrocities atlanta s uranus also conjuncts williams mars atlanta was a place where he could be unweildly where his martial desires were granted excitement where he behaved erratically and without concern for others atlanta s pluto in aries was also right on top of williams venus in aries in atlanta the darker sexual impulses of williams were awakened and colored with obsession with power with control and with disturbance ok that s mostly it,8,13,2020-04-27 21:46:21,0,2033,21

1336,how does our moon sign affect our emotions if science mentions how emotions may be caused by chemicals don t get me wrong i am a believer in astrology and i m into spirituality etc there are studies mentioning how emotions may be chemically induced in the brain i m at a criss cross of beliefs for one your planetary positions affect your energy and make up your energy at birth i ve always thought that emotions were spirit soul based so it was easy for me to understand how the moon sign would affect how deeply and how you felt your emotions since it s energy it s also confusing because i believe when we die it s only our material body and our spirit energy still exists and spirits feel emotion so then how would that be possible if they re chemical reactions i mean of course science isn t always accurate and it s what we think according to brain patterns and correlations but then again the evidence is there but then again evidence linking to energy spirit is there too i don t mean scientific studies so i don t know can it be both what do you think i believe in science too it s just kind of numbing and upsetting to think emotions are really nothing more than chemical reactions especially if they can be controlled by hormones almost like they don t really matter in a sense,9,0,2020-04-28 01:44:15,0,244,1

1346,echoing patterns through charts in families i have found a weird kind of echoing pattern through my parents and my chart my sun is in gemini and so is my dad s and i understand the sun can signify the relationship with the father likewise my moon is in aries and my mother s sun is aries what s interesting though is my mum s moon is in capricorn and she always talks about how her mother my granny was quite emotionally reserved my mum on the other hand is extremely emotional as she always says but i think this is down to her moon being in the first house her emotions are always centered around herself too now in my natal chart my moon has a tight conjunction with saturn by one degree and i wonder if this has to do with my mother s capricorn moon energies having been in therapy and examined my family relationships a lot one thing that was picked up on was that growing up i wasn t allowed to express my anger like my mum reacted really badly to it and my dad was increasingly emotionally distant which taught me not to express it and i think it really took something from me i struggled with mild severe depression for the majority of my teenage years my therapist really emphasized that i needed to find my anger i had therapy before i got into astrology so when i found out about my placements i was like bruh anyway another thing about my dad his moon is in scorpio sextile pluto degrees and his mother died when he was just a baby his dad died a couple of years later so he experienced a great loss he doesn t have a lot of friends and doesn t really emotionally connect has more so in the past years i sometimes wonder if i inherited his trauma my th house is ruled by scorpio with a sag pluto in it and my chiron is in scorpio rd house though my social confidence has been very low much of my life and i have always found it hard to make friends in the sense that it takes me a long time to be comfortable and fully myself around someone i do have a virgo rising which i think contributes to this at one point in my life i did lose my dad he left our family and i chose not to speak to him for a year our relationship is healing now though unfortunately i don t have my grandparent s charts which would be really useful in developing this theory further i wonder if anyone else has found the same thing sorry for the long post i am new to reddit,7,11,2020-04-26 21:31:46,0,465,21

1355,th house does anyone else here have an th house stellium how does it impact you i find this is one of the most complicated houses as everyones first association with it tends to be friendship then ambitions and dreams and one s overall relationship with society but i ve noticed my upcoming solar return charts have been hounded with the th house badly aspected and in planets such as pluto which can be used to predict death in the family and even moreso than the th house my th house cusp is gemini and it contains venus mars and saturn mars and saturn are in cancer and mars is at degrees this has taken me a really long time to understand because i ve always thought of myself as really independent and somewhat of a loner which didnt make sense until i did more research on saturn my saturn in th manifests heavily for me and seems to overpower venus and mars i dont have close friendships but i find actually i think about my friends and the people who i talk to like constantly and they impact my subconscious a lot i ve always had trouble making friends though and have had a lifelong aversion to any kind of group mentality when i was younger especially and more immature i just hated anything that was popular and always was on the outside looking in i ve grown out of this a little because i became less judgmental of others while also more confident in my originality people with a lot of th house influence are you into politics and are your ideas considered new and different i m not exactly passionate about politics but i can be at times i dont see myself as a leader or an activist though some may think my views are extreme but i m more or less indifferent and i keep my philosophies basic like let people do whatever they want as long as doesnt harm others i am an anarchist and would prefer less organization over more my ideal society would have little to no influence from the government i am opposed to both capitalism and communism i do have my strong opinions but like i feel like these arent actually as important in my life as you d think im more concerned about myself than the world and i definitely live in my head maybe politics will gain more emphasis as i grow older becuz i m and the th is ruled by saturn time back to the topic of friendships i do tend to make friends who are older than me and who definitely expect too much of me and kind of drop me for good if i fail to meet their expectations you know what i mean like its always been rough and i ve felt like i cant rely on anyone its everyone for themself i can see how mars make sense for that too and i am really competitive the friends i do have are definitely extremely artistic though venus and as saturn s position would suggest i m really close with my grandparents and i still have yet to cover the house in its entirety i am extremely ambitious my whole life revolves around my future it seems i have big plans and i think i have a remarkable ability to manifest them which i m still learning to improve i m very much dont dream it be it i ve seen people say the th house is also associated with intelligence and even genius i wont boast or anything but i think this is a possibility for others lastly it also relates to social media i do tend to go on social media much more than i d be comfortable with since saturn in th has given me a life of feeling isolated and untrustworthy of others i dont really share much of myself but i lurk on it a lot and when i do crave attention and validation the desire for it can like consume me i am overcoming this because i want to be even more independent i actually would like to get rid of my phone for a long time anyway sorry for wall of text i really want to hear other things about the th house and your own experiences with it especially in positions such as pluto or chiron houses and signs shouldnt be put together but for reference my only aquarius placement is th house neptune also my th house cusp is aquarius i also have uranus in th so i definitely can tell my significant other is gonna be weird af i hope this doesnt qualify as a question about my own chart because it isnt mean to be i dont need an explanation about my own i clearly understand it pretty well lol i m a leo rising so i have a strong sense of self and my st house contains things in virgo too so i like to analyze myself,15,11,2020-04-26 06:32:15,0,845,6

1377,trying to understand the elements better so astrology is becoming quite amazing to me and the more i study it the more i am amazed about how accurate it is to me however the elements are still kind of confusing to me actually really confusing like i get that earth signs are capricorn taurus and virgo and i can see it inside peoples faces without even needing to get to know them i think it s because earth signs have very distinct bones structures so it s easier to tell from appearence alone what sign they are however my question is what makes people of a certain element and how can i visualize how this element looks what i mean is before i thought that elements in astrology were just metaphors to describe personality but the more i study astrology and after reading astrology psychology and the elements i am realizing that the elements are not just metaphors but are in fact a direct manifestation in a persons personality and physical body we are all made from the same material as anything else on this earth or universe just variations of elements so here are my questions why are earth signs seperated throughout the year like there are seasons so why are each element scattered thoughout the seasons why not just have element all in season also how can i visualise each sign in a materialist way if that is even possible i m a virgo so i need to really be able to visualize to understand how these elements act within a person this may be too abstract a question but what exactly is cardinal fire not sure how any element can be cardinal fixed earth this makes sense sort of mutable air cardinal water fixed fire mutable earth earth is solid so it seems kind of weird that earth is acting like water cardinal air fixed water mutable fire cardinal earth new earth earth that is moving moving forward growing like a tree fixed air this is confusing to me because air is always moving so how can it be fixed mutable water isnt water always mutable x b im not really sure what i m asking like all of this is organized so well and makes some intuitive sense and is very poetic however there is something here that i am just not grasping of how to really understand and visualize these things it s like in music like i feel and understand music on an intuitive level but when i study music theory it just seems like magic like how a half step can completely change the mood of a chord from positive to negative sorry for not really being clear i m not exactly sure what i m asking myself,7,8,2020-04-24 20:08:36,0,465,20
1378,transits for spiritual work healing and herbs when it comes to certain non recreational spiritual practices such as holotropic breathing or psychedelic therapy we know that set and setting are of crucial importance it is already hard work in and of itself to confront these traumas plutonian shadow work so it s only normal to look for an appropriate environment too a journey with potent plant medicines can either result in a life changing and delicate healing experience or a disatrous spiritual emergency event it s a form of subtle surgery if you like it should be noted that not everyone s psyche is adapted for some of these depth psychology tools for instance extremely clairvoyant people neptunian and people prone to schizophrenia with sensitive connections to what is called their higher mind alongside a porous ego may lack the required grounding for these methods so they should use more progressive tools instead the famous depth psychologist who created the field of transpersonal psychology once said i have come to regard astrology particularly transit astrology as the long sought rosetta stone of consciousness research providing an essential key for understanding the nature and content of holotropic or non ordinary states of consciousness both spontaneous and induced stanislav grof so on this subject i have two questions and i would love to see your feedback on this in general what are the favorable astrological transits for psychedelic therapy while a physical surgery would not recommend a full moon perhaps here this would be interesting to release more repressed emotions can the moon be in the sign of the heart leo or the head aries or perhaps avoiding the body parts being metaphysically operated on probably look for harmonious aspects with the sun and the moon and the planet ruling the sign of the th house occult surgery positive influences of jupiter and venus in the th house health perhaps avoiding retrograde mercury venus mars if possible avoiding aspects with lilith chiron south node i m not sure avoiding negative aspects with saturn avoiding saturn pluto synods according to thousands of observations by grof while jupiter uranus synods have shown positive creative breakthroughs grof again what house and sign is pluto in and what about mahadashas perhaps avoiding retrograde mercury venus mars if possible avoiding aspects with lilith chiron south node i m not sure avoiding negative aspects with saturn avoiding saturn pluto synods according to thousands of observations by grof while jupiter uranus synods have shown positive creative breakthroughs grof again what house and sign is pluto in and what about mahadashas this could also depend on what kind of plant medicine we are using western alchemy and spagyrics has tried to establish planetary correspondances with most herbs indeed all plants crystalize in seven basic crystal structures if i have to guess i would say that some entheogens are very plutonian like iboga the dark jewel some very solar yang san pedro and others are more lunar watery feminine yin like ayahuasca the archetypes that appear during the trip can hint at this ayahuasca often takes the form of a female women diana or venus or a snake tradionally cannabis is a herb of saturn agrippa paracelsus although the salvia family being tied to saturn makes more sense to me according to my chart and its transits should i engage in psychedelic therapy this summer august or delay it to later i ve been considering getting into some delicate shadow work related to a powerful medicine plutonian or solar which triggers temporary egodeath suprisingly pluto has been transiting in my th house for the last years and this transit chapter has more years to go before it moves into house this made me realize why i have been getting quite deep into the occult during all this time all culminating to this recent climax i am also in the middle of a year long saturn mahadasha which has been been hard work initially i was considering doing a session in the beginning of august but has brought up an collective extreme transit with pluto saturn jupiter in capricorn which happens to be in my th house it seems that life is telling me to go for healing and occult work during these next years pluto in house however perhaps i should wait for next year when saturn in aquarius moves away from jupiter and pluto i also have my first saturn return coming in a year https preview redd it aqi jnqamtu png width format png auto webp s cf fdee e e fb e ba efda,14,2,2020-04-25 03:53:43,0,766,3

1422,the cancer archetype feminine authority and a mother s wisdom cancer is a sign that has suffered more from the historical subjugation of women than any other sign it s a feminine sign strike one it s an emotive water sign strike two it s ruled by the moon the planet of women and motherhood strike three the same stereotypes that were designed to break down women and put them in their place are the same stereotypes pushed onto cancer in astrology circles today weak histrionic irrational unstable not in control of their emotions it seems cancer has been pegged as the weepy nurturer with not much else to offer a weakening influence on a chart that mindset speaks more to societies view on femininity than it does to the sign of cancer it seems to me cancer is in need of a re framing the cardinal signs offer different brands of leadership the forceful military command of aries the fair and democratic leadership of libra the firm and responsible hand of patriarchal capricorn and finally cancer the matriarch the feminine authority for whatever reason i m picturing a circle of women on a beach beneath the moon tapping into their feminine power supportive leadership emotionally driven leadership leadership that sustains and nurtures those that it directs and governs leadership that connects and instills a deep sense of belonging this is the nature of cancer and its ruler the moon the queen of the heavens beloved of her subjects cancer is the life giving properties of water water that is nourishing enriching life affirming water that rushes forth to envelop and cause everything that it touches to flourish it is where mother ocean surges forth to meet land creating one of the most dynamic landscapes on earth a place where life thrives it is the creative nexus of the womb and the birth of a child into the world at the breaking of the waters a vulnerable but powerful moment when emotions are heightened and hearts are open this is not weakness this is strength to walk through the world open and receptive is potent and remarkable to take something so vulnerable and nurture it to full strength is a feat and this is why jupiter is exalted in cancer there is nothing jupiter cannot accomplish in the life giving summer solstice sign of cancer where creative life force is in absolute abundance it s also fair to say that for the majority of people the person that guides them advises them offers wisdom and support is their mother good mothers are the counsellors gurus and guardians of all that they support this is a vital and inherent yet overlooked quality of cancer energy and so jupiter loves it because here he has the broadest reach you may not open up to a priest but you will open up to your mother and so we see the protective guiding hand of the matriarch guardianship feminine wisdom and intuition emotional attunement and responsiveness cancer is the waves and the tides of the ocean ebbing and flowing pushing and pulling ever fluctuating like the waxing and waning of the moon but the waves and tides are not always gentle they can turn forceful as the mother who defends her child as the matriarch who defends her community as the moon goddesses of old who were both tender and nurturing but fierce and so cancer shields those who need them they take something small and vulnerable and nurture it to the point it can be delivered into the world this could be a person it could be an idea a business a creative project all nurtured and grown infused with genuine emotion and birthed into the world the creative potential of cancer is only rivalled by the other luminary sign leo together they light the world if you made it this far thanks for reading i hope you see how the lack of respect cancer receives in modern astrology is unjust and is a legacy of the subjugation of the feminine i hope this also brought some validation to people with cancer placements who feel overlooked or poorly represented we are not told that we are powerful we are not told we are charismatic we are not told that we are intelligent we are not told that we have much to offer beyond being of service to others so it s often a long road to learning to love our cancer placements i m there now i see how special and powerful it is and hopefully this has helped you to do the same,125,461,2020-04-22 09:00:53,0,771,9
1423,today and the usa last night i remembered austin coppock and chris brennan on the astrology podcast speculate on events that may take place around this time timecoded video here https youtu be wl ui cgk t h and the quote recorded march th speaking on the new moon conjunct uranus on april nd chris new moon new moon hits uranus a thrust for liberation but then in seeking freedom an urge for freedom the moon squares mars and you get the mars significations austin this is just speculation but maybe there are some places where people go into protest mode against quarantines there s chaos mars stirs action on an emotional level mars stirs anger so we may have something like that towards the end of april well here we are it s april nd and in the united states there are protests occurring to end these lockdowns some states are beginning to halt protests with public safety as the reason cited but this will surely just add fuel to the fire escalating already boiling tensions the above speculations turned reality coupled with the fact that these protests seem to be originating in the us made me wonder why here why is the country going through this current transits to the united states if we take a look at the us natal chart and check transits for the new moon on april nd we see some interesting configurations occurring transits us natal chart uranus square north south node a mercury conjunct chiron s pluto opposite mercury s chiron square jupiter s new moon square north south node a pluto square chiron s saturn conjunct south node a new moon square pluto a conjunct jupiter chiron opposite saturn a reading a few interpretations for the above on astro gold we can see the phrases an unexpected crisis may arise stretching your communication skills to the limit pluto opposite mercury you may even suffer from a disease saturn conjunct south node fate is forcing a change in direction uranus square nn avoiding painful thoughts or news is unwise it is time to face the truth and forgive and forget mercury conjunct chiron now is a time when you are saying goodbye to one phase of your life and entering a new one you come face to face with the past and have to make some difficult decisions life becomes filled with situations that can no longer be avoided saturn conjunct south node this is quite a challenge as you firstly have to face the obstacles from the past even if it means facing the fact that you are often your own worst enemy chiron square jupiter deep healing and deep pain are both possible either way you are required to delve within for answers and to try new methods of handling your problems pluto square chiron it is up to you to listen learn and move forward sun square nn it is fairly clear the united states is going through a major moment in its life the events that take place now and into the near future will shape the nation into something entirely different in the coming years initially as we are currently seeing the beginning of this trend this will be an incredibly painful time for the nation and its people as the ways of the past will not get the the country out of the hole it is in new ideas must be implemented positive action however i do despise the doomsday talk the power of astrology is that we can look ahead see that there is a tomorrow and react proactively to current events it doesn t seem that positive action will take place in the short term due to the current astrological trends but if we are to believe that astrology is the be all end all the nation s leadership could look to the stars and see how one could take the current situation as an opportunity to reinvent itself april nd transits us natal chart opportunities come but once in a lifetime now is the time for you to be open to opportunities chiron trine north node s now is the time to take a chance and explore new and unusual experiences to tackle life s problems in an inventive and original way particularly those involving metaphysics science and computers chiron sextile uranus a you may not be in a practical mode but you are open to ideas new ways of viewing projects and a more creative approach neptune trine mercury a this is a time of rejuvenation and regeneration when you have the opportunity to release troubling aspects of your life and walk a new path chiron trine ascendant a right now you are able to evaluate your direction in life and make adjustments to help you stay purposeful you may not realise it but you are changing in ways that will enable you to achieve your ambitions particularly in the area of career pluto trine mc a many of the above beneficial aspects will be playing out over the next months and years positive change is coming and although initially painful what is happening now will propel the nation forward in incredible ways it will only take time the nation and pluto transits couple the above by also looking at past us pluto transits as the nation is going through its pluto return and we can see a pattern arise source https yearparty wordpress com tag pluto return opening square mexican american war this lead to a massive expansion west across the current united states would new states be free or slave states this being brought to the forefront of people s minds lead to the civil war many years later and sowed the seeds for universal freedoms across races genders and peoples these would come up over the following decades opposition the new deal socialist ideologies became front and center and along with wwii helped the us get out of the great depression closing square reagan free market capitalism reduction in government spending and deregulation now we are at the pluto return the country will be forever changed by inheriting lessons of the past three major configurations yet i believe the opposition primarily points to where the country is moving towards the age of aquarius first i do not believe we will see any majorly positive changes for the nation until the jupiter saturn conjunction in aquarius december before then the nation will enter another great depression corporations will be shuttered or move out and unemployment will be widespread democrats could take over the house senate and presidency in resulting in a massively swayed political spectrum the moderate democrat biden and republican dominate supreme court will help the aquarian changes occurring at the federal level from being overly drastic the nation will take years to recover from current events a broken united states may cause other nations to try to posture themselves and take advantage of the weakened super power through diplomacy or war the world s nations will be preoccupied with this while the us just like in the s was left alone as to not wake the beast during this time the nation will heal grow supercharge and ready itself for the age or aquarius faster than any other nation will be able what will this look like possibly a swift nation wide move to clean energy debt relief healthcare and income reform the widespread adoption of remote work a shift to suburbia living new modes of low cost and speedy mass transit city greenification a strong focus on arts and creativity a new internet an explosion of international travel and tourism globalization a stronger united nations an ultimate pause in conflicts and likely much more that we can t even begin to fathom why will this happen because a great fall always precedes an incredible rise america specifically is not as fragile as we think it is conclusions if i may say one last thing in the coming months when the headlines get loud and foundational cracks become fissures take a deep breath and try not to worry remember that there is a tomorrow and tomorrow will always come the united states will become a beacon of hope and freedom again i can only hope that it won t be the only country to do so no matter where you are in the world use today to plan for the future be the change you want to see work towards a better tomorrow a tomorrow built on the foundation of peace and collective growth now more than ever the world needs it,5,34,2020-04-22 23:06:55,0,1444,23

1452,the th house asc dsc line and mc ic line why is the th house is typically referred to as the house of what s hidden the reason i ask this is because in a typical birth chart reading there are four directions that give a sort of reference system which the central point of the chart measures with respect to we can simplify this to two axes because they are in pairs i m talking about the asc dsc line and mc ic line the asc direction is the the direction of the eastern horizon the dsc is your western horizon mc is midheaven or top of the sky and ic is imum coeli or bottom of the sky with all that being said why is the th house what is hidden as it lies just above the horizon where the sun rises couldn t one say that things located around the ic such as rd and th house are truly hidden as from the perspective of the center the bottom of the sky is never in view i do understand the signs play a role in what each house means i guess maybe i don t know what the deal is with the mc ic line i ve heard that the ascendant is your first experience upon brith and the descendant is what you need more of i am confusion could anyone describe the properties of these important points and lines as well as answer why the th house is that what s hidden even if it is in view from the perspective of the chart owner,9,5,2020-04-22 04:21:29,0,269,4

1458,happy taurus season what do you appreciate about taureans taurus season started yesterday and so i wanted to make a post dedicated to appreciating taurus since i feel like taurus is never really talked about and is very underrated i find that i come across a lot of taureans probably cause i m a taurus descendant and almost all of them i meet i find them to be nothing short of amazing i believe that taurus is the kindest and loyalest sign out of the zodiac and they re very caring as well taurus offers a stable support system that you can certainly rely on they always offer a hand to those they care about they re great at advice and can help you see the beauty in life s most difficult situations they will always be there to encourage you to keep pushing forward even when your life seems to be getting off track and they do this in a very gentle caring and nurturing way if you re lucky enough to be friends with them you ll know that they offer a ride or die type friendship and they will always be thoughtful of you you will also be aware that the stereotype of them being boring is far from true they will surely have you entertained even in the most mundane situations they are as loyal as they come and will not only fend for you in your presence but in your absence as well they offer genuineness stability loyalty and beauty to your life and i very much appreciate all the taureans i ve had the pleasure to befriend,284,339,2020-04-21 02:36:58,0,273,2

1460,allowing transits to cause fear pluto hello i m wondering if anyone has experience having the knowledge of an upcoming transit cause deep fear and dread this has been happening with me ever since i discovered i will be experiencing pluto square my moon for the next nearly three years everything i ve read about it points to immeasurable suffering and doom it makes me really frustrated because i ve always used astrology as a positive tool and now it is filling me with complete hopelessness but a persons chart and transits aren t just about one aspect are they can t good things happen during a negative transit aren t there always other transits going on that point to happy times as well as bad i can t imagine years of non stop pain pluto is also trining my venus so perhaps that will transmute some of the negativity its just rather maddening reading all these cookbook definitions of what a pluto to moon transit means when in reality there are very few firsthand accounts of peoples own personal experiences through it due to pluto being such a slow moving body i m wondering if anyone else has shared a similar experience allowing predictive astrology to cause fear and pain rather than being a tool for growth and guidance i am at the point where i don t even want to use it any longer if it is going to impact my psyche so negatively,9,5,2020-04-22 00:09:35,0,246,0
1461,how does your moon find motivation as the title says i m curious to hear how you find motivation depending on your moon placement i know that many things could play a role in this but motivation is such a raw emotion in the end it simply boils down to wanting something right that in my opinion it s first of all connected to our moon you re free to disagree on this let me know what you think now as a lazy cancer sun with an enthusiastic but not very consistent aries moon i feel that if it weren t for my diligent virgo rising i wouldn t get anything done however when my moon is into it i e when i feel motivated i really see a difference i know that stereotipically speaking aries moons love to start new things taurus moons love to see things through etc but it would be great to find a way to motivate myself starting from what i know about my placements for instance why i try to do at the moment is to throw some variety in the things i have to do be it working out or studying and to break them into small sections the pomodoro technique seems to work great with me so that i m not facing endless boring chores and i m actually more motivated however i m trying to think about ways to improve this so i m wondering if you ve ever thought about the relation between your moon and the way you find self motivation,28,6,2020-04-21 23:35:49,0,262,23

1485,thoughts about the modalities cardinal fixed mutable how they interrelate i noticed that cardinal and fixed energies seem to have more in common and overlap with each other in their strengths and weaknesses and abilities almost as if the fixed sign can do everything the cardinal can but better and longer why does cardinal energy seem like a sort of fixed lite then there is the sun sign trine pattern where each sign of a certain element looks up to the next one in a mentor mentee dynamic but it s expressed with subtle differences owing to the qualities of each modality so cardinal energy being perhaps the youngest of all three aries would look up to leo the way a younger brother looks up to an older one and between the mutables and cardinals there is a fun bantering mischief type of best friends in crime dynamic that is not shared with the fixed signs any thoughts,5,1,2020-04-20 20:31:44,0,158,20
1486,juno through the signs here s a little astrology humor for you the capricorn way of course because i m bad at jokes the more i work with juno in personal charts the more i want to see how she is applied to the mundane for those that don t know the mythology juno is the wife of jupiter you can replace this for any pantheon i prefer to use the roman nomenclature for common astrological reference despite being queen of all gods she was not satisfied with jupiter relationship with her she wanted more from the benelovent god and found herself always wanting even when she had it all juno spends approximately years in each sign written by marie rousseau juno in aries you tend to find that the other person is never as motivated as you d like them to be they just don t seem to have as much action or will to do things no matter how much they accomplish or how quickly they do it it just isn t fast enough taurus why can t your partner just reach the moral levels of a god you find they either never have enough money for your liking so what this person is a billionaire they can be a trillionaire if only they d save every penny and their values always seem to be lacking gemini your partner just never knows enough they never communicate enough you want to know all the information and even if you had their entire biography in a book the fact that their future endeavors aren t written as well is unsatisfactory cancer you just need someone who understands how to nurture you every waking minute your partners never seem emotional enough for you they should be just as moved by things as you are and you can t seem to get what you feel you need even if they held your hand on your death bed your ghost would be pissed off they didn t weep uncontrollably into your dead chest leo they could lay a red carpet out for you turn their ig page into nothing but pictures for you and the endless love they have they could play every board game with you in existence and it s still not enough attention your partners always seem too serious and not as playful as you as well virgo if mr mrs clean was an actual person they still wouldn t satisfy the level of hygiene you expect from your partner you also always seem to get the person who misses the details why can t they ever be on the same analytical level as you libra if your partner shared their soul with you the fact that they didn t share their ipad with you as well is a cause of distress you just want things to be fair and they never seem to be quite as fair as you d like they also lack the tactfulness you expect in a partner and even if they presented themselves well the two different colored socks that only you can see is embarrassing scorpio you tend to find your partners are not as deep and probing as you are and they re not as suspicious as you either it is so hard to get them to be less trusting of others as you seem to find them always inviting people in and there s never ever enough sex sagittarius put the funniest comedian and the greatest philosopher on earth together and they still wouldn t live up to the expectations you have you love to travel and they never seem to want to go to enough places even if they traveled the world any instance of them behaving closely to what s familiar to you disappointment sets in capricorn why do your partners find everything so damn funny why aren t they as orderly as you why are they so weak questions you ask yourself constantly you just want them to take life seriously and if they don t boss up to your liking you feel let down aquarius your partner needs to leave your technology alone they need to get more technical and fix everything if they can t troubleshoot their own phones you start to wonder why you even bothered and no matter how intelligent they are they never seem smarter than you pisces is there a reason your partner needs to be in your space and know everything you surely wish they didn t your partners always seem to loud even while they re sleeping they think too much when they could be dreaming instead and you ll never understand why the mundane world means more to them than a good ol fashion meditation even a monk couldn t satisfy your need for peace,6,6,2020-04-20 11:05:19,0,805,11

1508,north node in aries these are some notes i took on my nn in aries from the chapter in jan spiller s astrology of the soul i recently posted notes about pluto in the th house and it seemed like people found lots of value in it so i thought i d share these as well i recommend jan spiller s book for anyone interested in deepening their understanding of evolutionary past life astrology x b aries nn people blend their energies with others to avoid standing out as an individual they are so sensitive they fear that being acknowledged could be overwhelming they are accustomed to melding their energy with those in their immediate environment to support others effectively they are tremendously aware in past lives their tools were love reassurance gentle words of encouragement and confidence that the other person would emerge victorious in any situation their focus was always on the other person they were part of a team and if their partner did well this ensured their own survival although this worked well in past lives in this incarnation another person s happiness is not enough to evoke true happiness for aries nn folks they don t have enough personal identity left in their battery to hold the charge from the other person they must focus on developing their own identity and recharging their own battery they merge with the other person s energy field in a very codependent way they plug into the other person s energy and add whatever ingredient is needed to keep things harmonious they have the ability to see not only the rough edges in people but their loving qualities as well they perceive who others really are and they celebrate the truth in that state they feel high they are fully celebrating the glory strength energy light and life in the other person it makes them feel incredibly loving their challenge is to see the same beauty in themselves they relate to the relationship the other person rests at their personal center they must de emphasize the idea that relationships are necessary for their survival if only i can find the perfect partner i ll feel complete in myself this feeling of completeness they seek can only be achieved individually they have lived a lot of householder lifetimes they love to give its in their nature but their motive needs to be love not codependency if they feel resentful they need to pull back to recharge it is crucial for them to have their own space surrounded by their own possessions to reinforce their sense of identity they can appreciate the beauty in all their choices which makes them indecisive they are accustomed to appreciating the beauty of everything outside themselves they aren t in touch with having favorites of anything because they don t know what their own tastes and preferences are they have a tough time picking one thing and saying this is it in this lifetime they are developing single mindedness rather than weighing everything before making a choice they are learning the value of following their initial impulse rather than the referee these natives are supposed to learn to be the point of view when they feel an impulse they need to follow through with it owing to self purification in past lives they can trust that their impulses are not harmful to others when they notice selfishness in others they should use it as a reminder to check in with their own needs inconsistency and lack of routine will undermine their personal strength so daily consistency is important additionally they could have a weekly routine like attending a place of worship this will counter their tendency to feel victimized by the randomness of life it will give them a sense of structure and discipline from within rather than floating in and out of other people s energy and consciousness a routine helps enhance their own identity,8,14,2020-04-19 01:54:42,0,661,1

1526,why do you believe in astrology or even follow it a little obviously anyone is into astrology to various degrees i ve just recently tried to dive into the details of it all a lot more however i am very interested in science which is holding me back due to the amount of scientists that turn their nose up at it i have no judgement here genuinely i don t have an opinion on whether astrology is real or not i have researched the science behind astrology and what i unfortunately found was that hardly any people have tried to fact check astrology and also that most astronomers completely dismiss it i know there is a couple of scientists that support astrology but that s all why such a small number i realise a lot of people won t be concerned by this but i struggle to make sense of everything even though it seems to hit the nail on the head every damn time i am quite a spiritual and curious person not religious as such but also very into science astrology just doesn t make sense to me which really holds me back from learning more or feeling like i really understand what is going on for example why are the signs of the zodiac classified as they are is there something more to it than someone once deciding to pick out certain stars into a pattern and that was that or is there some more logical methodology which has given meaning to the constellations as we classify them today there is so much meaning given to the symbols used in astrology but where has that come from so i m curious as to what you guys believe about what astrology is and where it has come from what validates it to you why do you follow it and trust it just to reiterate i have no judgement i believe in astrology because the more i learn the more it resonates with me but i just can t get my head around the practicalities of it edit just want to add that i do have a personal relationship with astrology it has helped me immensely and i find it very useful and unnervingly accurate ha but i m also very curious about it,53,22,2020-04-18 00:11:45,0,385,0
1527,explaining the concept of exaltation domicile detriment fall in placements what these seem to really mean skip to the last paragraph to see a huge point if you re not reading all of this thoughts nbsp a placement is exalted when it is communicated as easy to understand because of the world s way of seeing things a placement is domicile when it translates as a common and smooth understanding to the world a placement is detriment when it does not translate as a common and smooth understanding to the world a placement is falling when it is misunderstood and cannot be easily communicated because of the world s way of seeing things nbsp here s an example of exaltation domicile detriment fall in sun signs nbsp the placement of your sun sign has to do with the ego what you want some of your goals and how you want to be noticed it s sort of like how you demand respect and keep an ego nbsp leo sun wants to feel superior in every situation socially constantly making mental connections to themselves of why they are validated and why they are superior leo sun wants to be seen as king of the jungle when its ego is taking its control this is commonly seen in today s world and society as understood smoothly as in it makes sense to society to act like a leo sun might act when it comes to having an ego nbsp the sun is detriment in the sign aquarius because aquarius focuses on the state of society the world innovation and equality it acts detached but has an ego in the sense that it doesn t want its own goals to ever control itself aquarius sun uses their ego in a sense for the sake of humanity and its own goals this does not translate to the world the majority of today s society as being smoothly understood in terms of having an ego nbsp sun in leo is seen as domicile because in the way of the world and society today it might commonly be seen as understood smoothly in terms of having an ego leo sun can always feel a loss of control over its own ego when it feels invalidated or threatened in terms of its status as superior leo sun focuses on itself because its ego will take control and be seen as a force to be validates and seen as worthy maybe superior nbsp exaltation domicile detriment fall seems to involve the concept of being understood or misunderstood as in no placement necessarily has more benefits or less benefits for example libra sun is seen as falling and aries sun is seen as exalted which seems to have to do with the idea that the state of the world society currently more commonly believes that an ego is more smoothly understood in aries and misunderstood in libra if the majority of the world society misunderstood the aries sun ego it would be falling if the more common belief of the world s understanding of an ego was libra it would be exalted nbsp exaltation domicile detriment falling involves the most common beliefs of the world society and makes a placement exalted if it can be understood smoothly in terms of what the placement involves because of the way of society and the world today libra sun would be seen as falling because it lacks the common understanding of focusing on themselves in order to maintain an ego this is what makes a falling placement falling in relevance to the sun this is the same with every celestial body placement due to the most common way of understanding for the world and society nbsp a measure of sun signs from exalted to domicile to detriment to falling would in theory be based on the more common views of the world and society the concept that placements have any more benefits or less benefits is false as this has to do with the state of human culture in today s word and society nbsp here s another example moon in scorpio is seen as falling this seems to be because moon in scorpio s benefits come from intense emotions and coldness without allowing people to affect their emotions at all scorpio moon acts cold and focuses on what s right through how a person should be treated due to human psychology feelings this placement has benefits through what seems to be its vast human emotional understanding tendency toward psychological analyses and the concept of how to stay cold enough from allowing your emotions to be affected by other things and other humans nbsp this is seen as falling because of the majority the most common of beliefs in the world and society currently it could and would be the opposite and scorpio moon could be seen as exalted depending on the majority of the state of the world and society s beliefs nbsp all placements have benefits and exaltation domicile detriment fall involves how easily understood or misunderstood placements are to the most of the world society all placements are beneficial even with fall detriment domicile or exaltation,5,5,2020-04-18 05:38:35,0,867,5

1530,pisces venus mercury are hard placements this is all coming from my personal experience but im curious whether others feel the same notice i say feel because thats what pisces is all about their logic is swayed by feelings and their own inner world i find myself and other pisces mercury s struggle with overthinking anxiety its as if they are too susceptible to their environment and when in a toxic environment its easy for them to become intoxicated it feels like im constantly in a daze a lonely daze because its easy for pisces to be a martyr and feel sorry for themselves or that the world revolves around them i find unevolved pisces energy cant see the big picture like aquarius for example can and instead they only see what they want to see based off their imagination its like being in a constant vortex pisces venus is also considered an exalted placement but i for one think its also very challenging love is complicated and pisces is willing to explore love and have unconditional love but they also are willing to suffer more than whats necessary again unhealthy venus pisces will literally make themselves suffer at times because they need to feel like theyre being that martyr fighting a good fight and if theyre not suffering are they really loving anyway thats my hot take on my own placements that im struggling with i know its not all pain and sadness but its possible,168,141,2020-04-17 09:12:21,0,247,9

1540,the key to saturn transits is patience saturn is very unrelenting but what ppl don t realize is saturn is mainly self imposed planets that come after mars or the personal planets are reactive it s the world around us reacting to our own actions it s out of our control yet still impacted by our decisions pretty much it ll happen regardless saturn saturn is conclusive as is mars and pluto and combining them gives a person killer instincts not in the brutal way but very much in a finalizing way and with saturn he closes useless chapters pluto closes destructive chapters mars closes whatever chapter he chooses but they all end things with saturn you have to be patient to have to let the storm pass you have to take care of business do what has to be done so you can lighten your load but you still have to deal with the ramifications i see that now as saturn is transiting my moon until it moves back to capricorn it opposes my leo moon let me tell ya i m lonely a lil depressed and just agitated but with the moon we often reflect and with saturn we are buried alive my emotions are doing just that but you have to be patient the storm always passes as does saturn saturn offers strength and wisdom by cutting you off you are cut off from what you deem important and when you are all alone all you can do is think but you have to do more than that because destruction with saturn can be hard to stop he is habitual by nature and uses repetition for his method but just be patient it s a test of virtue like hercules who i feel is also represented by saturn he is a task completer he finishes the job and gives his all cronos was not always bad it was his fear of karma that consumed him before that he ruled with grace and honesty that s the flip side to saturn but he comes to add depth wisdom and strength he comes to uproot things untangle weeds and allow for growth he removes restrictions by showing them at this time i must grow but when i do it will be powerful i slipped into some very bad habits but i can overcome them all it takes is effort so i will march down this path alone hurt angry but these are all emotions that i must uproot so i can be emotionally calm stable and at peace i wish i knew how this ends but i don t but i have been on the positive side of a saturn transit and when i was patient and controlled the benefits were just amazing be patient be honest be diligent and watch what flowers grow,63,138,2020-04-16 23:39:36,0,475,23
1541,the sacred riana i saw her performances both on asia s got talent and america s got talent and though i was disturbed and scared a couple of times i found them sort of cool out of curiosity i looked up her chart because i found it interesting how she managed to develop her craft in a country that s still at least superficially quite dominated by the abrahamic religions indonesia i thought she would most certainly be a scorpio sun and or with heavy pluto influence in her personal planets turns out she s actually a cancer sun same sign as me but i was right about the plutonic influence i don t know her time of birth so i don t know if her moon s in sagittarius or capricorn nor her rising so i can only use noon i have to say that despite her performances being scary and all that to me she poses a kind of dark and mysterious sexuality which i must admit turns me on despite me not having any major pluto aspects to my own personal planets forgive me i don t know how to post images yet so i would be glad if someone can kindly show me noon july jakarta indonesia sun cancer moon capricorn mercury leo venus cancer mars taurus jupiter virgo saturn aquarius r uranus capricorn r neptune capricorn r pluto scorpio r i suspect from her performances and her physical appearance that s it s very likely she s scorpio rising which would most certainly place her moon in capricorn without knowing her time of birth sun conjunct venus sun sextile mars sun opposition uranus sun opposition neptune sun trine pluto moon trine mars possible moon trine jupiter possible moon conjunct uranus moon conjunct neptune moon sextile pluto unlikely mercury square mars mercury opposition saturn mercury square pluto not sure if her venus is aspected mars square saturn mars trine uranus mars trine neptune mars opposition pluto as i suspected she does indeed have a heavy pluto influence dark mysterious occult with pluto aspecting of her personal planets of these are also challenging aspects mercury square pluto and mars opposition pluto i would not be surprised if she hasn t pluto conjunct her ascendant all of the oppositions to uranus i interpret as playing the major part in her eccentric tastes and image she wants to revolutionize she wants to be unique but this kind of uniqueness can come off as being hard to stomach for a lot of people at first the challenging aspects to neptune might point to some kind of identity disassociation or should i say a reflection of her more than one or even multiple conflicting identities and fantasies that she is trying to portray through her magic shows she s clearly upset disillusioned about something in the physical world we live in something that penetrates deep within her,3,1,2020-04-18 01:36:49,0,486,1

1558,scorpio placements brings challenges i ve noticed that scorpio placements especially as your big three or first house can give people with these placements a ton of challenges early on in life whether that be growing up in a not so friendly environment parent divorces abandonment not feeling welcomed loved or feeling out of place kinda like being a black sheep or having too much pressure put on you this may not resonate with everyone but i ve noticed it in people with scorpio in their sun moon and risings i have a scorpio rising with pluto and mars in the first house and i definitely felt like i grew up feeling unwanted and dealing with a lot of abuse and gaslighting but i feel like these challenges so early on are really meant to test our strengths and overcome them scorpio is the sign that has the power to delve deep into the underworld and come back out of the ashes fully transformed and evolved anyone else with these placements feel this way,155,253,2020-04-16 00:33:20,0,174,0

1590,why outer planets don t make good sign rulers and why st house does not equal aries nd house does not equal taurus etc so being a part of the astrological community and working professionally as a traditional astrologer when i talk about rulerships or houses there is no doubt that someone will quickly reply with but you re wrong uranus rules aquarius or referring to things as scorpio the th house is about this is a super touchy subject and people tend to get a bit upset when told that as a solar pisces they are actually jupiter ruled and not neptune ruled etc things get taken personally feelings get hurt resentments get built and its just not productive at all and both the traditional rulership person and modern rulership person walk away feeling worse than they did before so i thought i would make a post talking about why traditional astrologers use the rulerships and house associations they use so first of all the reason why traditional astrologers still do not use outer planets uranus neptune pluto as rulers is not because they don t believe in or use these planets first of all in traditional astrology we classify the relationship between a sign and a planet using what is known as essential dignities debilities in traditional astrology there are not just rulerships but several different types of relationships that a planet and a sign can have for the sake of simplicity here we will focus on rulerships but here is a table explaining the traditional dignities and debilities http www skyscript co uk dig html http www skyscript co uk dig html so i will say that when the outer planets are used uranus does find its dignity in aquarius neptune in pisces and pluto in scorpio they also have signs in which they are exalted in fall in detriment too so there is a relationship between scorpio pisces aquarius and the outer planets but the outer planets do not rule these signs or any signs at all and there is a reason the reason is that if we take uranus neptune and pluto and use them as the rulers of signs it messes up the complex system of dignities and debilities here is one reason with the exception of the luminaries the sun leo and moon cancer each of the other planets rule zodiac signs we have mercury gemini virgo venus taurus libra mars aries scorpio jupiter sagittarius pisces saturn capricorn aquarius thus if we add in the outer planets of uranus neptune and pluto as rulers knowing they are not luminaries who can get away with ruling sign we would have to assign the outer planets signs each no one has been able to figure out a way to do this that actually makes sense now onto the houses in traditional astrology the houses being ruled as h aries h taurus is a baseless modern disambiguation there are source texts that define the houses this way certain planets have what is called a joy in certain houses and that is the closest we come to houses being consistently associated with signs or planets here is a great paper by astrologer chris brennan that talks about the joys and the themes of all the houses http www hellenisticastrology com the planetary joys pdf http www hellenisticastrology com the planetary joys pdf the joys are as follows mercury s joy is in the st house the moon s joy is in the rd house venus joy is in the th house mars joy is in the th house the sun s joy is in the th house jupiter s joy is in the th and saturn s joy is in the th house the other houses that do not have a joy just do not have a planetary joy no planet necessarily rejoices in houses and no one knows exactly where the st house aries nd house taurus rd house gemini idea really took root my theory is that it seemed easy there were houses and signs so why not line them up its a totally modern creation heavily utilized within pop astrology as a way to simply break down the houses but technically it is inaccurate with no basis in any astrological source texts and if you want to say that the source texts of astrology make no sense and are old and dusty and nonsensical and our modern intuition has rendered these ideas archaic and inane maybe read a few traditional astrology texts first sometimes the wording or spelling can be a little huh at first but i have found so so much more value in these texts than on tumblr blogs or instagram not that i don t have some favorite ig tumblr astrologers it is simple to do the houses this way and shit it was my introductory idea about the houses too but as i read charts i began to find that it didn t make too much sense why do we need two different things that both mean the same thing as aries as well as this this idea about the houses and about the outer planets as rulers have caused people to begin to mishmash the house meanings sign meaning and planet meanings together losing the distinct value and original ideas about each separate concept a great book to read on this is called the houses temples of the sky by deborah houlding i had a free pdf version but can t find it now houses do still have rulers but it changes depending on the orientation of the houses in each natal chart whatever your first house is the ruler of that sign is the ruler of your st house and then the ruler of your nd house sign is that ruler of that house and so on ex cancer ascendant st house ruler moon nd house is leo ruler sun rd house is virgo ruler mercury and so on ps i prefer the oldest house system whole signs over the popular placidus but that s a story for another time or for the comments or something another distinction to make is that the outer planets move soooo slowly that the sign they are in makes personal or individual distinctions about the querent themselves uranus takes years to move through one sign sometimes longer neptune takes about years pluto takes anywhere between and years so if anything when talking about something like uranus in capricorn we should look at it as the uranus in capricorn generation similarly aspects between two outer planets like neptune conjunct uranus neptune sextile pluto etc do not have personal significance things that will make an outer planet notable within an individual personality are an outer planet closely conjunct the chart angles ac or dc ic or mc just being in the angular houses or does not have nearly as much significance as when they are actually closely conjunct one of these axis points an outer planet involved in a major aspect conjunct square trine opposite sextile to an inner planet it also has to be within orb neptune being degrees away from the sun moon etc is not a conjunction or being degrees away from an exact square trine to the sun moon etc is not a relevant square trine whatever either i just wanted to put some distinct information out here on why traditional astrologers say the things they do about rulerships and houses if this is strongly worded i apologize i just want to clear things up a bit if anyone else has anything to add put it below and please let s keep it civil all astrologers amateur professional modern traditional uranian etc are extremely bright and valuable tldr the outer planets don t rule inner planets because all inner planets other than the luminaries aka sun moon rule different signs so if we add the outer planets in it muddles everything the houses being lined up with the signs i e aries h taurus h is a modern creation of convenience the rulers of houses change depending on your chart if your ascendant h is taurus the ruler of h venus h mercury and so on edit i am not suggesting we get rid of the outer planets i love the outer planets personally i m just explaining this logic,92,89,2020-04-14 05:26:18,0,1400,5

1595,narcos organized crime astrology and my observation one of my favorite shows on tv is narcos something about the way it is directed and how it plays out really made it a show i binge watched this yeah late to the party for the first time to some degree the highest level of success with organized crime became something i ended up reading about and intend to leave it to just reading because in the end almost all of these guys get busted a lot it is fair to say that in the turn of the century the main type of organized crime groups that have been the most successful are drug cartels i say recognized meaning i know how everyone wants to say the catholic church or law enforcement are the real criminals but i am talking more about recognized criminal syndicates here i decided to look at natal charts of some of the most infamous cartel lords mainly from narcos but others from reading and found how a lot of them really tied into astrology let s start with the king of organized crime himself pablo escobar i was surprised to find that escobar was a sagittarius but then some of his antics started to slowly make sense to me especially bringing in wild animals from abroad to his personal zoo the aries moon is what time and time again showed how he was impulsive but then what about the long term success in such a cut throat game escobar had a mars in virgo adding cold and calculated to a violent nature lusting for violence now add in a mars conjunct saturn both in virgo you have someone who can actually play strategically now add gustavo capricorn as extra brains behind the organization this fueled the success that pablo had what i think really put him over the top pluto trines with inner planets so many of them and pluto sitting in a potentially exalted sign i hear that while pluto is domiciled in scorpio it is considered to be exalted in leo which kind of makes sense leo is associated with the crown ambition and gaining power i have found the sign to among the most strategic while also driven by an egotistical lust for power it knows how to climb the heights and operate in cut throat situations some claim that leo also sits in the highest dignity in mars not so jolly as pop astrologers claim after all but i ll talk more about that despite the favorable aspects for strategy it was ultimately escobar having an aries moon which i believe led to him destroying so much to the point that it all turned on him then add to that the very pluto in an ego driven sign which hungers for war enough about escobar though moving on the cali cartel gilberto aquarius vs his brother miguel leo the very season of narcos that brought me to actually make this post as much as i have talked about escobar i actually found the cali cartel more interesting simply because they made a lot more money and had more control on the international drug trade in the s i was most amazed at the difference in persona between gilberto versus his brother miguel gilberto was the chess player in control but one that preferred bribing to violence no need to go to war with anyone as the older brother he showed more long term vision and strategy even though the surrender ultimately did him in what changed my view was actually how much the cartel changed one gilberto was locked up and miguel the leo was in charge in typical leo fashion things got extremely bloody and violent violence intimidation threats wiping out the opposition and conquest became the new language you even saw the brothers argue and not get along being that they were of opposing signs miguel did not want to spread the wealth to him it was his cartel who were top and everyone else was there to watch they had to know who was boss you also had chepe libra and pacho virgo i was amazed by pacho given how calculated he was in typical virgo fashion i found that unlike escobar the cali cartel avoided violence unless they absolutely needed it the biggest culprit in them changing their ways was obviously miguel and his leo energy which made things violent ruthless and war like compare this with gilberto who thought progressively in aquarius fashion why all the violence if we can all find a creative way to just quit and start new lives then we go to narcos mexico with felix moving forward i noticed as i looked more into mexican drug cartels which are considered more cruel than the colombian ones there was so much capricorn energy who else to start this than felix himself i noticed it throughout the series driven cut throat and almost no respect to anyone around him which ironically did him in as disliked as he was among others i noticed how compared to other crime lords he was a lot more calculated the move to go after a dea agent ultimately cost him everything but outside of that he was constantly making all the strategic chess moves you had rafa who was the one that went after kiki the dea agent and i do not have the bandwidth yet to talk about his chart this post is already too long moving forward and observations immediately despite the associations with the underworld i was shocked to find a lack of scorpio energy in the cartel world i mean it was there but not nearly to the extent i thought it would be i found that other nurturing water signs like pisces and cancers rivaled scorpio for dominance in that world maybe there is something to be said for where pluto is exalted and scorpio gets a bad rap a bit too much what surprised me was that there are so many fire signs that climb to the top of the world of organized crime famously el chapo in recently memory who is an aries but also amado who was a sagg i did not expect this i thought that it would be earth signs that would dominate a lot then i noticed as i looked at the most cruel criminals in recent history in the world of organized crime particularly the cartels you hear the worst stories about in recent news what sign came up a lot capricorns by a large mile followed by cancer and then scorpio i feel like there is a certain type of sadistic and cruel nature to capricorn that cannot be rivaled an almost cold hearted demeanor you cannot contend with a certain kind of evil to the sign that manifests in charts that have too much of it that at its worst gives you a first class display of human cruelty after all it is a sign associated with satan so this post got too

1597,uranus toxic relationships even though i use traditional rulership i find the outer planets deeply important in chart readings in my studies i ve observed a few parallels between the placement condition of neptune pluto uranus as an indicator for patterns of toxic relationships these indicators could apply to an individual birth chart in which case the native would bring these tendencies into their relationships until they adapt their behaviours alternatively this could occur only in the context of a relationship in which case relationship astrology could provide some insight let s start with uranus uranian relationships are volatile they re unpredictable rapidly changing they can result from a learned association between affection a chaotic environment as uranus yearns for liberty it can express as having or pursuing someone with a fear of commitment subsequent secure healthy relationships tend to provoke anxiety as safety is unfamiliar there may be un intentional efforts to provoke conflict disrupt the peace a few ways this could manifest being addicted to the chase repeatedly breaking up getting back together frequent breaks pursuing emotionally unavailable partners an internalized persistent urge for freedom independence confusing chaos dysfunction with passion excitement if one can learn to overcome these patterns healthier manifestations include dating eccentric individuals or having unconventional relationships e g age difference open relationships distinct cultural backgrounds etc note that uranus is associated with what society deems unconventional rebellious revolutionary or challenging the status quo as uranus is relative to the current social landscape the partnership may be subject to oppressive forces this isn t meant to judge certain relationship dynamics but recognize the difficulty of being in a relationship that goes against the norm if any of this resonates for you look to your chart for the following indicators as a starting point outer planet s in the th house outer planet s forming hard aspects to the descendant outer planet s forming hard aspects to the ruler of the th house synastry or composite charts may illuminate this dynamic in the context of a singular relationship you ve experienced rather than a perpetual pattern in this case placements in angular houses or hard aspects involving the outer planets may play a role this is part one of a three part series next we ll explore plutonian relationships i f you want to read the rest of the series click here https www instagram com p b xj sbv j otherwise wait until later this week i ll post it to reddit,22,20,2020-04-14 06:19:10,0,417,6

1602,the ascendant through the signs this is based on what i ve specifically read and noticed about each sign as of now nbsp the ascendant is among the specific three sign placements that i usually notice others mention a lot the big three signs sun sign moon sign ascendant sign the importance of any placement and sign isn t necessarily the same and i ve read a number of times how these big three are written or talked about with the intention of finding an opinion of which one is the most effective or which matters more i might do other analyzing posts like this one for sun and moon signs and this one is for the ascendant nbsp the ascendant is about how you see the world and how the world sees you this is what these theoretical exaltations from greatest to least are based on again this is superficial and there s always more factors nbsp aries ascendant sees the world as a war zone but likes to fight fears relying on others and losing their independence own opportunities taurus ascendant sees the world as already peaceful in a way is logical and is self nurturing wants comfort and sees it as possible gemini ascendant wants to be seen as smart and quick and sees the world as fun exciting fears losing curiosity and their knowledge cancer ascendant believes the world is deep and emotional sees the world as their home and fears feeling like they don t belong anywhere leo ascendant wants to rule the world with their ego and needs validation and attention wants to be seen by the world and validated virgo ascendant focuses on details of the world before engaging with it fears imperfection needs to feel useful and knowledgeable libra ascendant sees the world as a utopia and sees the never ending potential of beauty the world has to offer fears a lack of balance chaos and competition scorpio ascendant sees the world as always wanting to hurt them big issues with loss fear of others ruining their life somehow sagittarius ascendant sees life as an adventure and an extravagant experience fears losing their sense of freedom capricorn ascendant sees the world as a ladder to success and fears never fulfilling their duty and reaching a high social status aquarius ascendant feels a need to never conform and always stay different unique to feel like they matter pisces ascendant views the world in a delusional way where all people aren t as bad as they seem even if they are nbsp thoughts on this what did i get wrong what did i get right nbsp i ve seen your comments here are the edits so far looking for more of your thoughts on the descriptions nbsp aries ascendant sees the world as a war zone and likes a challenge fears relying on others and losing their independence and assertiveness gemini ascendant wants to be seen as smart and quick and sees the world as curious and ever changing fears losing their open minded perception scorpio ascendant sees the world as always wanting to hurt them and is paranoid due to their intense emotions fears becoming too vulnerable and having no power or control sagittarius ascendant sees life as an adventure and an extravagant experience fears losing an opportunity for freedom and adventure pisces ascendant views the world in sensitive elusive way fears losing their identity and boundaries from always feeling others feelings and not prioritizing themselves,77,137,2020-04-13 09:37:51,0,583,9

1606,popularity and astrology i know that this concept might be a bit superficial for some but i was wondering what aspects and placements can contribute to someone s social popularity and if other people are drawn to them and like them i understand that there are aspects related to fame and career which create status based sense of popularity but what really interests me is the aspects that give someone that magnetic and warm personality and gregariousness that creates someone who is popular wherever they go and isn t dependent on their social status an example of this would be the person in high school who is genuinely popular and well liked but their popularity doesn t come entirely from their looks or money no regina georges or that person who can go anywhere and other people just know them and like them i would guess air signs lead the pack in being beneficial to social abilities and skills but i also think fire signs often tend to be pretty popular as well due to their ability to draw attention and their liveliness what do you all think about this are there any aspects or houses that can contribute to these social benefits,7,3,2020-04-14 02:04:23,0,203,2

1614,there are three stages to entering into the age of aquarius people have been talking about when we will enter the age of aquarius with many claiming we are currently entering the age right now while i agree that the transition effects can and are being felt right now i also believe we are still a long time away from the beginning of the age according to the stars take a look at this image https i imgur com kklezx png you can see the three stages are pretty clear the first stage will begin in years when the constellation of aquarius first shares the ecliptic right ascension of hours with pisces technically during this stage the sun will still be in front of pisces during the spring equinox it won t be until stage that the sun will be in front of aquarius during the equinox i e the boundary of aquarius intersects with the ecliptic coordinates ra hours dec degrees during this stage aquarius will still share the ecliptic right ascension of hours with pisces the third stage is when aquarius shares the spring equinox with no other zodiac constellation stage to stage will take years could this be the year period prophesied in revelation who knows just an observation blessings,13,33,2020-04-13 05:38:18,0,213,5

1620,understanding scorpio the reality of joe biden and democrat establishment explained i have long been a fan of astrology when it can be used to describe people and events in other words when it is actually most relevant to us one thing that has fascinated me when it comes to astrology is when it applies to politics sports competitive landscapes and how it all ties into the modern times as a result now i describe myself as a liberal and yes as polarizing as it may be a bernie bro i wanted to actually make this post because i feel like through understanding scorpio for better or worse i am able to understand what is really going on with the democrat establishment and joe biden although biden will be earning my vote come fall i have others thoughts on whether or not he gets re elected for starters who have not seen biden s chart he has a lot of planets in scorpio and i mean a lot i believe it is close to a stellium hillary also was a scorpio heavy chart as well when i say scorpio i don t mean the sun sign i mean an individual with a stellium or a scorpio heavy chart do as i say not as i do if you want to truly understand scorpio in its purest form that is the saying you need to have engrained in your head scorpio methods for getting ahead or gaining power are subtle and more behind the scenes compared to an aries mars a scorpio mars is more indirect and roundabout in its ways of getting ahead in life tactics such as guilt trips making the other person feel bad for being ambitious and taking the moral high ground are all too often the most common of ways in which a scorpio heavy placement will get ahead a scorpio heavy individual will rely on two things to get ahead and ultimately win out the other person is the type to feel guilty and almost go on the defensive unraveling and becoming more apologetic for their actions now this worked to excellence when biden debated ryan and the more classy politicians who were too hung up on being seen as good honest people none of your dirt gets out there as much even if it does it is overshadowed by the dirt of your opposition in other words hush hush think of a dictatorship where a dictator can get away with murder but everyone else has to be on their best behavior such is the way a scorpio placement attempts to court victory take advantage of the moral nature of people and have them walk on eggshells once again guilt trips and emotional blackmail are its weapon of choice you even see this in astrological circles with scorpios parading themselves as the strongest sign and how they will dominate every other zodiac sign just google it the desperation to be seen as the john wick of the zodiac i don t really hate the sign though given that i have a few placements in it rather i am talking about the less developed version of it for a scorpio its an appearance look one way outwardly and another way in private to those who really do know you well i ll talk more about this later a scorpio relies on silencing the opposition not really taking them on unfortunately they are going against trump as much as i wanted hillary to win so we can finally have a woman president the reason trump won is because he has no guilt and is not the apologetic type to make matters even worse trump s chart which i will get to shortly is a scorpio s nightmare trump aired so much of hilary s dirty laundry in his campaign that it put hillary in a tough spot and in unfamiliar territory now let s talk about the unfamiliar territory for a scorpio being challenged scorpio heavy charts are not really used to being challenged and when they are in more of an open area with the crowd watching they unravel scorpio placements thrive more in private in the dark and behind closed doors a scorpionic individual might rig aspects of the game to their favor so it is an easy path to victory for them when the game is played more in an open arena like a debate or an area of high transparency a scorpionic individual tends to be in a weak setting the reason is because a scorpio chart relies on secrecy and does not really want people to know everything about it hence the facade and trying to keep things private as for trump s chart even though astrologers have been drinking the scorpio kool aid and calling it the strongest sign these days i think that a number of signs just have its number gemini is one that comest to mind but also leo and capricorn trump has a lot of gemini and leo in his chart this is why it is relevant gemini and leos will drag the competition out in the open yes they are very foolish and clownish signs but what people see is typically what they get the signs are more open and outward performing signs who can defend themselves in public they thrive in those settings on top of that they air everyone s dirty laundry gemini is ruled by mercury and represents the media the word getting around in other words a scorpio s absolute worst nightmare yes dirt might continue to come out on a gemini or leo but they will defend it away with ease people who love them will love them while those who hate them would have hated them anyways a scorpio is not good at doing that they have a lot of skeletons in the closet that they cannot have getting out a scorpio s worst nightmare is having to do a conference where they have to explain all of the dirt of their past they live everyday to ensure that never happens unfortunately for biden i think he will have to do that this election and will end up being soundly defeated by trump due to trump having the heavy gemini and leo

1633,extraterrestrial astrology ideas implications and discussion how will it be like to make a natal chart for a baby born on another planet how will it shape psychology how will transits work for people who were born on earth but visit those places will the new influences match with their names in all cases what will be the influence of the earth gaia terra maybe similar to ceres venus what will be the meaning of the planet that you live on for example what will mars mean to you if you already live on mars it will no longer be a planet to be used on charts there will anything of the above distort sign rulerships how five case examples i can think about mercury the closest planet to the sun has an orbit that is inside those of venus and earth therefore any aspect between planets such as an opposition between sun and venus is possible here the sun turns retrograde part of the time planets take longer to move across the houses than across the signs and the sun only stays a few days on each sign a day is longer than the year venus and earth are very prominent the moon the earth always sit in the same house which is entirely defined by location not time earth slowly moves through the signs as the month long lunar day goes on every other planet including the sun behaves similarly as it does on earth mars mars has a year that is days therefore the sun takes about twice as long to transit each sign its day however is only minutes longer the earth behaves in a manner similar to venus does on earth and mercury and venus have tighter separations from the sun mars s two moons phobos and deimos complete an entire cycle on a matter of hours do their prominence and speed suggest that fear and dread will be prominent issues for martian natives gas giants moons in the case of the closest ones the planets they orbit around occupy more than an entire sign rings are prominent especially near saturn fellow moons look quite prominent too each one with a pair of transiting nodes and each of the moons transiting the whole chart in a days to weeks and retrograding every now and then as on our own moon the planet never changes house but it moves across the signs time as long as that moon takes an orbit eclipses are dramatic and happen often the sun spends on each sign as long as the planet takes to transit them on terrestrial charts year at jupiter at saturn and so on all the planets from mercury to mars including earth are mostly conjunct the sun extrasolar planets constellations as we know them are either distorted or don t exist at all it is still possible to find a valid aries point and derive the signs from there another star with completely different properties dominates the sky while our sun is nowhere to be seen a set of strange planets with completely different cycles dominate the charts,2,5,2020-04-12 20:49:31,0,522,20

1646,the planet jupiter i felt compelled to write about my thoughts on the planet jupiter for anyone who might be interested the good and the bad imagine you re staring up at the stars or standing at the edge of the grand canyon overlooking the vast expanse in front of you it s awe inspiring it fills you with wonder it makes you realise that there are much greater forces at work beyond your tiny little self the realities of bill paying and mundane chores are a world away you look out at the horizon and start to think big and dream and hope you suddenly have a sense of perspective understanding faith belief in something greater something higher something more this is jupiter it is epic in scale legendary mythic beyond words it fills you up and carries you on a high makes you soar on optimism and a fascination for what s out there waiting to be uncovered and explored it makes you seek out and discover it gives you meaning and purpose in life it s your compass this is why it s the greater benefic it rules priests and sages and gurus and philosophers and scholars those who dispense advice and spiritual wisdom those who journey to find the truth and then teach and preach it to those willing to learn and jupiter does have the potential to shower you with knowledge wonder and blessings astronomically it s the great protector its gravity pulling in comets that would otherwise smash into the earth and slinging them away into deep space however jupiter can also become self righteous self aggrandising and self mythologising like the sun it can have an inflated sense of self importance which with jupiter can veer into i m divinely chosen my beliefs are the right beliefs and i m meant to do something great it s my calling jupiter can become a zealot jupiter can also be too abstract and theoretical and ungrounded not at all rooted in reality the professor who lectures from their ivory tower who promises a lot with big dreams and grand visions but doesn t always deliver jupiter can leave you disappointed and disillusioned the expectations you had about your life lying in pieces all around you you ll see all these themes the good and the bad in the two signs it rules sagittarius and pisces you ll also see in them jupiter s indulgence its indulgence in experiences alcohol drugs food tv whatever your vice is jupiter when unhealthy will want more of it the expansiveness of jupiter becomes untameable and unmanageable and can spiral into addiction i wrote a bit of an essay there but i love writing about jupiter i feel i can speak to its nature with some authority because i have it conjunct my ascendant and aspecting other vital planets in my chart but i feel it s important for all of us to access our jupiter and find that greater sense of purpose and vision in our lives i d love to know your thoughts on jupiter,73,161,2020-04-11 00:02:45,0,517,0

1651,relationship astrology synastry composite electional this is a follow up to our post on compatibility astrology https www instagram com p b mvmlphnyb today let s chat about the three main methods to assess compatibility synastry composite charts electional charts let s start with synastry as it s probably the most popular method in western astrology atm synastry or chart comparison is a tool to assess the interaction between the birth charts of two people it s represented by an inner outer circle to represent each individual synastry is helpful for comparing how individual characteristics impact relationship dynamics it can illuminate strengths weaknesses or places of ease tension the key thing to remember about synastry is it s about how energies influence on another is there magnetic attraction mars are you emotionally in tune moon do you have similar communication styles mercury etc a cool thing about synastry is that different charts will have different planets of focus at different intensities this reflects how different relationships have different purposes e g platonic vs romantic individuals have differing values e g communication vs sexual chemistry composite charts on the other hand combine the two charts into one using the midpoints to represent the relationships as a unit i ve heard them best described as the way in which a relationship takes on a life of its own what is the output of these two parts combined imo composite charts allow us to focus more on the houses see how this merging influences different areas of life in addition you can see how transits impact the couple as a whole rather than individually in synastry one of the key components of astrology is aspects which represent the geometrical or angular relationship between planets synastry observes the aspects between charts while composite charts review the aspects within the chart there is also some merit of looking at the charts of milestone dates first meeting when relationship was initiated marriage etc a branch of electional astrology the principle here is that the timing of events has influence based on the arrangement of the cosmos this is actually common practice in some cultures where astrologers are consulted to help select the most auspicious aka favourable date to have a wedding it s important to state that relationship astrology is not only designed for romantic relationships it can be used to assess any one on one relationship parent sibling friend boss etc i even heard of one astrologer who would draw up a synastry chart with their client prior to their first session together i hope this brief overview was helpful more posts like this on sunmoonsquare https www instagram com sunmoonsquare,5,11,2020-04-11 04:48:46,0,446,4

1674,does the rising have to do with how you see new people general friendlines so it is well known that the rising sign influences how new people see you but i am wondering if it also influences how you perceive new people for example how friendly as enjoying the socializing not talking about being a nice person a person is in a work environment with people who are not close to him etc what made me think about it is that i know a taurus sun woman with whom i worked and she is really really friendly to anyone she has this strong friendly vibe i am taurus sun as well however scorpio rising and people see me probably as intense and don t approach me much which is kinda fine by me i don t care much for socializing if i don t really like someone but i believe that this woman really enjoys the friendliness that she is sending out i think that people see her so friendly because she really enjoys the socializing with many people btw i don t know her rising sign so i wonder can the rising dictate as well how one may experience the socializing with people kinda foreign to him,26,15,2020-04-10 05:01:25,0,208,5

1677,question to all about predictions this has been on my mind for some weeks now if this may sound rude please accept my apologies it s not my intention english is not my first language but i try my best to be as polite as i could i m only requesting for you guys to share your knowledge and your opinion i have been reading quite a bit about astrology incredibly fascinating i m just not sure my mind is smart enough to handle it i ve also been listening to quite a few on youtube with their predictions and many are dire in their warnings and that the world would never be the same again and there won t be any stability until around the middle of the decade or even before it ends come this september it will be worst than this horrible thing we are all going through etc i ve seen many doom and gloom predictions before is this time any different in your experience and in your interpretation are these predictions anything special in the sea of previous earth shattering predictions that came before are these conjunctions so unique and when they happen it s always terrible i really do respect what you guys know here i m actually concerned because i have a young family i d like to know from all of you in your opinion will life go on and be good after this terrible nightmare and we can all go back to some sense of normalcy or it really does go all downhill from now on from what you ve been personally reading and interpreting regardless of the predictions some say on youtube i ve seen it mentioned that the astrology charts we have now are akin to what they had when the plague started or ww or the beginnings of ww or other catastrophic timelines in our history is this correct have these alignments ever happened before has there been benign results or when these conjunctions happen it s always globally catastrophic would you kindly expound on this thank you all and be well and safe,3,1,2020-04-10 11:16:10,0,356,11
1678,this is how to like to think of and explain the big sun moon ascendant i want to emphasize this isn t all my original thought with astrology it s pretty impossible to not integrate the works and studies of others into your interpretations and explanations and general understanding the inspiration for explaining the big in this way comes from the only astrology book you ll ever need in this book joanna woolfolk explains the sun sign like a the broad strokes of painting which i mention below i really loved this analogy and then found ways to apply that thought structure to the moon and ascendant but also just with astrology in general it has allowed me to be able to hold a deep yet simple enough understanding to explain astrology to others my friends and partners always ask me about astrology and after getting insecure and frustrated with not being able to explain certain concepts i used parts of other people s work to come up with this explanation the ascendant will highlight certain aspects of your personality some you aren t even aware of a book i read the only astrology book you ll ever need put it this way if you consider yourself a painting the characteristics of your sun sign are the broad strokes that the artist first lays down in the canvas the artist outlines your general shape the planes and angles of your face the way in which you hold your body in the same way your sun sign delineates your general character the moon in your horoscope modifies your sun sign it brings new forces different motivations and special elements to the character of your sun sign i like to add this to the painting example i think the moon would be the shadows and highlights of the picture still black and white filling in some of the empty spaces giving you a deeper understanding of the character that is being drawn these can often be the more hidden aspects of the personality your knee jerk reactions instincts the pieces of yourself you repress from others even yourself your ascendant rising is the sign that reflects your outward demeanor and to s great extent determines how the outside world looks at you very often your ascendant is what the world first sees in you the impression that you first make to other people many astrologers believe that your rising sign is more immediately revealing than your sun sign i like to think that the personality you outwardly project is almost always a perfect blend of your sun sign and rising sign it is this combination that makes your unique impact on the world i also like to add this to the painting example if you think about it when you are looking at a finished painting of a character your interpreting the final product you re looking at the colors the emotion in the eyes the shape of the lips the overall vibe the artist intended to give off rising you aren t really seeing the broad strokes and the outline the artist first laid down to create this image sun but you instinctually know that these concepts are there and these big shapes make up the image you certainly aren t seeing the shadows and angles and highlights that were there moon to tie everything in you are really just seeing the mask the final product what the artist wanted you to see rising as you get to know the painting more as you sit with it it hangs in your living room you will notice more and more about it and different aspects will be uncovered like the whole birth chart,26,138,2020-04-09 07:20:04,0,621,7

1702,placements which scare you i m not asking like which signs intimidate you i m wondering if there are any placements in your chart which make you nervous there s no reason to let your chart scare you but i think its an interesting topic for example i use the campanus system which gives me uranus in the th house which fits me just fine and all but it came to my attention that a lot of people use the whole sign system which i dont really like but i looked up my chart while using it for the first time and it gave me uranus in the th i know nothing in astrology is a guarantee but like i thought i would be the last person to get in a freak accident get struck by lightning anything like that basically it can indicate a sudden and highly unusual death but like most th house placements its more likely to just apply to regular boring things like money i can be incredibly paranoid so that made me nervous anyway but like luckily that house system is otherwise not accurate for me campanus is perfect for me i have some peculiar th house placements which are a bit unsettling for me a hypochondriac of course i would be i have chiron in th and virgo in st but anyway i also have neptune in the th which can indicate an incredibly rare illness that is difficult to treat but because neptune represents that which is hidden it is usually just an indication of mental illness or general disillusion with daily life but still its not great for health and can give you something undiscovered or difficult to understand oh and as for pluto it s conjunct my moon and opposite my venus and there are sooo many things like saturn in th that suggest being lonely and i have mercury in the th but i love mercury in th,47,2,2020-04-09 00:18:50,0,328,0

1708,shame through the eyes of pluto let s talk about shame shall we we often use the terms guilt shame interchangeably but i feel it s important we distinguish them guilt is a feeling of responsibility or remorse for wrongdoing an awareness that our actions have injured could harm another shame on the other hand is painful feelings that contribute to an internal schema of perpetual inadequacy unworthiness etc researcher bren brown says that the difference between shame guilt is the difference between i am bad i did something bad guilt is a useful response on a societal level as the emotional distress that arises discourages future harmful behaviour through guilt we learn adapt which strengthens us psychologically shame is the absolute opposite it harms our psyche unaddressed shame often leads to emotional disconnection isolation our false beliefs reinforce suffering brown identifies that shame grows with secrecy silence judgment we can tackle shame by challenging our negative self talk being vulnerable practicing empathy but how does this relate to pluto pluto is associated with power polarization compulsions destruction etc where we find pluto in the birth chart can illuminate where we experience shame i m no stranger to shame i ve got pluto sitting directly on my ascendant therefore i need to address shame as related to my self concept where does pluto lie in your birth chart and how do you experience shame in your life i also have a graphic on pluto through the houses on my instagram story https www instagram com sunmoonsquare if you want to get inspiration on how it could apply to you,20,7,2020-04-08 08:32:18,0,269,8

1713,jupiter and saturn wisdom jupiter is the visionary the philosopher the pilgrim saturn is the architect the elder the authority they are the two wisdom planets jupiter is the wisdom we seek out that we journey to discover both out in the world and within ourselves the more we experience the more we understand it s the wisdom passed down to us from our gurus and mentors who seek to inspire and enlighten us to expand our vision and our horizons saturn is the wisdom we gain through life s hardships disciplining us to mature to take responsibility to have dignity and respect for ourselves and our authorities it s the elder who s failures and setbacks have made them a wealth of insight on the lessons they learned across a lifetime just some thoughts on two of my favourite planets it s also interesting to me that jupiter has a clear resonance with water and fire cancer exaltation pisces rulership sagittarius rulership whereas saturn has resonance with air and earth libra exaltation aquarius rulership capricorn rulership i think that elemental division speaks to their natures quite well where are they in your chart do you feel those houses are sources of wisdom for you,6,3,2020-04-08 10:46:21,0,205,10

1716,working with difficult aspects in your chart i got this email from astrolada this morning and found it quite interesting the way she plays around with planet archetypes and remediation she illustrates them very simply which i thought could be a great tool for anyone who finds aspects hard to interpret from her my comments in italic parenthesis this is the one topic in astrology i am most passionate about remedies for difficult configurations in the horoscope what is the point of scaring a person about a difficult configuration they have and not giving them a solution ugh yes this but here is how i use the natal chart to give the way out say you have a very tight hard aspect between mars and venus you might fight a lot with your partners attract quarrelsome such even be in danger of violence in relationships you might spend money venus impulsively mars you might be more susceptible to kidney venus infections and so on what is a remedy to this i would look at any other planet sending an easy sextile or trine to mars or venus say neptune sends a trine to your mars then you should consciously focus on doing and introducing mars neptune things to take off the tension from that mars venus square for example swim neptune liquids mars exercise or do yoga neptune spiritual exercise mars or dance mars to music neptune or do something mars for charities neptune or when fighting with a partner and wanting to be mean instead say a prayer neptune to your self in the heat of the moment mars or carry the icon of st george saint neptune killing the dragon mars ot another warrior saint and pray to him for solving of your mars venus problems i inadvertently do this i have a scary moon opposite pluto but neptune trines my moon and i keep an archangel michael pendant bracelet or prayer on me at all times if you happen to have a positive aspect to your hard aspect you have a huge relief and you naturally incline to find more constructive solution in the planet with the saving aspect i can give you another very personal example i have mars conjunct venus in a tight opposition with pluto a classic combination for sexual attack which happened once a predator abducted me in a car when i was but i have neptune trine venus and mars and sextile pluto and moon also trine venus and mars and sextile pluto so two saving aspects to this aggressive combination from two very gentle calm and receptive planets what did i do to save myself i became very kind and even loving started asking caring questions and sympathizing with the kidnapper neptune moon and was constantly praying neptune in my mind too i even started talking to him about god and love neptune this immediately softened the attacker and he let me go i am not saying this will work for everyone but for people with gentle aspects from neptune or moon to aggressive planets this will if i had uranus trine instead shocking the attacker by screaming and even jumping off the car would have worked better but what happens if you have no good aspect to a difficult configuration in your horoscope i guarantee you that at least one person of your immediate family or friends would have a planet making a good aspect to your hard configuration this person will be your saving grace yes synastry is more than just are we compatible it s about having people in your life no matter the relationship who can fill in the problematic holes of your own my mom s jupiter conjuncts my moon and she is a person i always call for for support or a dose of wisdom having a mars saturn conjunction and you feel like strangling someone but your mom dad friend husband has a mercury trine to your conjunction then call her and talk it out mercury with her she will save you from many painful actions for example i have mercury opposition saturn not a single good aspect to this mercury no saving grace mercury rules my th children i find it highly difficult to deal with them on my own within minutes i get overwhelmed and capitulate unable to make a decision or snap myself out but my husband has his saturn and mercury trine mine the moment he enters the room i snap out of this stupor and can handle the children with more calm he becomes my voice mercury of reason saturn me mila is refusing her vegetables since a few days she will never eat again vegetables and her immunity will go down and she will catch every virus followed by me feeling depressed saturn opposition mercury negative self talk my husband mila stopped eating vegetables a few times for weeks and then started again she had just as strong immunity then she will start eating again immediately my doom and gloom saturn mercury opposition gets soothed and corrected by my husband s reason and reality check mercury saturn so find yourself someone who eases your hard aspects with their good ones and whenever the problem of the hard aspect manifests go in the presence of or talk to that person they will be your solution what do

1727,people who are not as in tune with astrology alright so everyone knows about the very base of astrology by this i mean most people know about just their sun sign and don t realize that they have multiple other signs assigned to them that shape their personhood and personality but on the other hand there are those who know but don t believe in astrology at all because they have no idea how in depth it can be my question might be stupid to those who have studied astrology for years unlike me who learned over the past few years by associating with friends who are deep into astrology and noticing patterns as i meet different people i also picked up a book that gives little blurbs about all the sign placements in all the planets and in all the houses it enlightens me a lot to say the least but anyway i m not sure if i m wording it in the best way possible but my question is do you think that people who are not as educated about or who don t believe in astrology are still affected by astrological events for example the moon entering libra tonight and the sun lying in aries right now and if so do you think their lack of knowledge affects the degree to which they might be affected shaped how they experience life until the event is over etc or is there no difference at all between those believers and those non believers note i am a full believer in astrology just not as educated on it as some of you subscribers to this subreddit might be so please nothing about my beliefs,7,2,2020-04-08 02:52:30,0,284,2

1747,lunar nodes the distorted concept of karma the lunar nodes have vastly different meanings in astrology depending on who you ask in vedic astrology the lunar nodes are referred to as rahu ketu the head tail of the snake in western astrology they re called the north south nodes and we often hear the terms destiny fate karma thrown around to describe their meaning but let s get something straight the use of the term karma in the western world was appropriated from the east morphed by judeo christian beliefs the western interpretation of karma in its essence is an illustration of justice retribution what goes around comes around it s an illustration of the judeo christian ideology that our actions determine whether we end up in heaven or hell the east teaches us that there is no final judgment in few words the true definition of karma is action and rewards or punishments are the result of karma not karma itself karma can be seen as the perpetual pattern of actions across lives through reincarnation over time though our actions tend to accumulate create tendencies therefore we bear consequences for past actions in past lives nevertheless karma is the free will agency to either repeat patterns or break free from them this ties into our understanding of the lunar nodes as karmic patterns in western astrology from south to north that which is innate to that which is acquired the undeveloped to overdeveloped aspects of our character familiar to unknown stagnancy to expansion self undoing to self actualization action is the only thing standing in our way how do you understand use the the lunar nodes in your practice more posts like this on sunmoonsquare https www instagram com sunmoonsquare i m not super well versed in vedic astrology and i m not going to pretend to be so the bulk of this post is focused on western astrology,16,9,2020-04-07 01:03:43,0,320,1
1748,can we give regulus some clout regulus king maker and the archangel raphael which rules fortune success courage was in leo for years and i recently read when it first entered leo julius caesar was born along with the grandparents of jesus christ around it moved into virgo and despite having profound effects i rarely see it talked about to me the effects of this transition are profound we re entering a time of feminine tranquility and acceptance although obviously not ecumenical in influence many cultures all over the whole world particularly western are taking on the gentleness of virgos feminine energy not to be totally liberal which i m not lgbt people like me lol and women have flourished wether you think this is true or not it s undeniable millions of people are getting rights and acceptance which was unheard of for pretty much all of recorded history virgos tarot card is the hermit a highly respected card which represents deep wisdom i ve only been into astrology for a couple of months so sorry if some of what i say is inaccurate but to me virgos are kind they want to help people they re logical and practical and aren t afraid to improve the world i think most of humanity has felt virgos gentle and virgin influence although you can argue a lot of our culture is very sexualized i still think this reflects virgos traits embracing the sexuality is embracing acceptance of everyone no matter their personal choices and at least what i ve seen is virgos are actually pretty intense people when they open up after all regulus is incredibly bright and powerful i d love anyone else s opinions on this especially anyone with planets conjunct regulus and how they think it affects them i think regulus moving into virgo is beautiful for humanity and as an amateur i d love to hear others opinions on this,3,1,2020-04-07 12:06:27,0,324,12

1750,this could be interesting as the physical body what signs possess what physical strength naturally here s my take on it going based off of what body parts the signs rule as well as the constellation aries taurus have strong muscles naturally it can be easy for them to tone out their body gemini and virgo are fast sagittarius can be fast as they rule the the thighs but can have precise aim i play softball with a sag and she hits her target with a lot of force and precision capricorns can have the strength of aries and taurus but also the agility leo s can be agile and have good reflexes aquarius and pisces can be fast but those air and water elements can slow them down they can use a lot of force if they use their strength in their feet and calves now i m not too sure about cancers and scorpios i d say cancers can be very strong like taurus perhaps quicker than taurus though scorpio s can have a strong core i think abs can be easy for them libra can have balance obviously although that might not always be in their favor they might have a strong core as well if you think about it you need a strong core if you re constantly balancing things with both arms,12,5,2020-04-07 00:55:37,0,227,0

1825,does how close a planet is to the next house sign affect it beginner question hello i m just starting getting deeper into astrology and couldn t find this info on the faq and google gave me unrelated results i m not asking questions for anyone to interpret my chart but on the general knowledge i can then apply to my chart and other readings i m merely using mine to illustrate examples i know cusps are not a thing but do planets being very close to borders between houses signs affect them if someone has a planet very close to the border between two houses does the influence of the planet trickle into the next house same for signs my sun is in my second house but only a few degrees away from the third house i use placidus but some systems actually put my sun in my third house i can definitely see some parts of the third house being relevant to my sun even though it s not technically in it with the system i m using my uranus is also on degrees and minutes within aquarius would the interpretation really be as cut and dry as if uranus was a lot further in aquarius thank you in advance for any help if there are any articles on this i d love to read them too,2,5,2020-04-03 09:59:42,0,229,9

1829,moon pluto aspects mothers unreliable interpretations i ve been looking over quite a few charts recently as a beginner and am struggling with interpreting both adverse and tightly conjunct moon pluto aspects aside from natal specifics many resources on the aspect broadly indicate a protracted controlling relationship with the mother so far it s been much more accurate to interpret moon as mother in my culture emotions tending towards abnormal extremes among other things but i want to focus on these two for now i ve covered individuals with this aspect only one of which a tight conjunction experienced an overly controlling obsessive mother and some of which had maternal problems much better explained by a different moon aspect extant in the chart eg moon th opp neptune th for a social butterfly mom who severely neglected her daughter her home only of them agreed to the second point about experiencing severe emotional extremes coloured by the houses aspects involved and exhibiting controlling behaviour of their own i suppose there s a degree of self reporting bias involved here but i ve had exponentially better luck with many other unsavoury interpretations like mars sq saturn or merc opp neptune can someone with more experience shed some light on this how do you normally interpret this configuration especially wrt mothers,38,39,2020-04-02 18:39:49,0,219,18

1852,which transits progressions can signify a revolution social unrest i ve been following the pluto saturn conjunction and movement of saturn into aquarius and i can definitely see this as a global turning point a cataclysmic shift in collective awareness but i am curious to know whether anyone has studied social unrest through history which transits progressions can signify or hint at a revolution or widespread social unrest obviously last year there were huge protests and a growing surge of social unrest from haiti to barcelona to hk and i imagine pluto and uranus have to be involved but right now in this confinement feeling of oppression and removal of civil liberties it feels hard to imagine a rebalance in power and a collective shift when people say there will be a shift is it just a positive spin on it or are there a collection of transits that echo big revolutions whether that is literal or ideological social throughout history,11,4,2020-04-02 07:54:28,0,161,7
